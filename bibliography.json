  {"id":"ahujaTraumaticSpinalCord2017","abstract":"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating consequences for the physical, social and vocational well-being of patients. The demographic of SCIs is shifting such that an increasing proportion of older individuals are being affected. Pathophysiologically, the initial mechanical trauma (the primary injury) permeabilizes neurons and glia and initiates a secondary injury cascade that leads to progressive cell death and spinal cord damage over the subsequent weeks. Over time, the lesion remodels and is composed of cystic cavitations and a glial scar, both of which potently inhibit regeneration. Several animal models and complementary behavioural tests of SCI have been developed to mimic this pathological process and form the basis for the development of preclinical and translational neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies. Diagnosis requires a thorough patient history, standardized neurological physical examination and radiographic imaging of the spinal cord. Following diagnosis, several interventions need to be rapidly applied, including haemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit, early surgical decompression, blood pressure augmentation and, potentially, the administration of methylprednisolone. Managing the complications of SCI, such as bowel and bladder dysfunction, the formation of pressure sores and infections, is key to address all facets of the patient's injury experience.","author":[{"family":"Ahuja","given":"Christopher S."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Jefferson R."},{"family":"Nori","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Kotter","given":"Mark R.

  {"id":"andrasicSpeedChangeDirection2021","abstract":"There are a plethora of studies investigating agility in soccer; however, studies have rarely presented the reaction time in differentiating age groups in adolescent soccer players. We investigated age differences in reactive agility, speed, and change of direction speed (CODs), in a group of highly trained adolescent soccer players. A total of 75 adolescent male soccer players (aged 14–19 years) were recruited. The players were grouped based on their age to under 15 (U15; n = 27), under 17 (U17; n = 25), and under 19 (U19; n = 23) players. Players were tested for 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m sprint, CODs speed test, Illinois test, and reactive agility test (total and reaction time). Only the reactive agility test with a live tester (RAT live) and RAT live reaction time (RAT live RT) distinguished U19 from both groups, U17 (RAT live, p < 0.01; RAT RT live, p < 0.01) and U15 (RAT live, p < 0.01; RAT RT live, p < 0.01). Groups did not have different times for 5 m sprint, RAT light and RAT RT light, F = 0.472, 2.691, 1.023, respectively, p > 0.05. Moreover, a significantly slower average performance of sprint 20, CODs left and right, and Illinois was also observed in U15 as compared to U17 and U19 (p < 0.05). We can conclude that results in agility tests that include live testers can be a significant factor that differentiates between adolescent soccer players considering their age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrašić","given":"Slobodan"},{"family":"Gušić","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Stanković","given":"Mima"},{"family":"Mačak","given":"Draženka"},{"family":"Bradić","given":"Asim"},{"family":"Sporiš","given":"Goran"},{"family":"Trajković","given":"Nebojša"}],"citation-key":"andrasicSpeedChangeDirection2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph18115883","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"language":"en","page":"5883","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Speed, Change of Direction Speed and Reactive Agility in Adolescent Soccer Players: Age Related Differences","title-short":"Speed, Change of Direction Speed and Reactive Agility in Adolescent Soccer Players","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/11/5883","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"askenMultiModalBiomarkersRepetitive2022","abstract":"Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) criteria were developed to aid diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) pathology during life. Interpreting clinical and biomarker findings in patients with TES during life necessitates autopsy-based determination of the neuropathological profile. We report a clinicopathological series of nine patients with previous repetitive head impacts (RHI) classified retrospectively using the recent TES research framework (100% male and white/Caucasian, age at death 49-84) who completed antemortem neuropsychological evaluations, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (n = 6), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (n = 5), and plasma measurement of neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and total tau (n = 8). Autopsies were performed on all patients. Cognitively, low test scores and longitudinal decline were relatively consistent for memory and executive function. Medial temporal lobe atrophy was observed in all nine patients. Poor white matter integrity was consistently found in the fornix. Glucose hypometabolism was most common in the medial temporal lobe and thalamus. Most patients had elevated plasma GFAP, NfL, and total tau at their initial visit and a subset showed longitudinally increasing concentrations. Neuropathologically, five of the nine patients had CTE pathology (n = 4 \"High CTE\"/McKee Stage III-IV, n = 1 \"Low CTE\"/McKee Stage I). Primary neuropathological diagnoses (i.e., the disease considered most responsible for observed symptoms) were frontotemporal lobar degeneration (n = 2 FTLD-TDP, n = 1 FTLD-tau), Alzheimer disease (n = 3), CTE (n = 2), and primary age-related tauopathy (n = 1). In addition, hippocampal sclerosis was a common neuropathological comorbidity (n = 5) and associated with limbic-predominant TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 4) or FTLD-TDP (n = 1). Memory and executive function decline, limbic system brain changes (atrophy, decreased white matter integrity, hypometabolism), and plasma biomarker alterations are common in RHI and TES but may reflect multiple neuropathologies. In particular, the neuropathological differential for patients with RHI or TES presenting with medial temporal atrophy and memory loss should include limbic TDP-43. Researchers and clinicians should be cautious in attributing cognitive, neuroimaging, or other biomarker changes solely to CTE tau pathology based on previous RHI or a TES diagnosis alone.","author":[{"family":"Asken","given":"Breton M."},{"family":"Tanner","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"VandeVrede","given":"Lawren"},{"family":"Casaletto","given":"Kaitlin B."},{"family":"Staffaroni","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Mundada","given":"Nidhi"},{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Corrina"},{"family":"Iaccarino","given":"Leonardo"},{"family":"La Joie","given":"Renaud"},{"family":"Tsuei","given":"Torie"},{"family":"Mladinov","given":"Miho"},{"family":"Grant","given":"Harli"},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Ranjani"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kevin K.

  {"id":"bakerPassiveHipMovement2016","abstract":"Reduced sagittal plane range of motion (ROM) has been reported in individuals with hip osteoarthritis (OA) both during walking and passive testing. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between hip extension ROM recorded during gait and passive hip extension ROM in individuals with moderate and severe hip OA, in comparison to an asymptomatic group. Sagittal plane hip ROM was calculated using skin surface marker trajectories captured during treadmill walking at self-selected speed. Passive hip ROM was measured using standardized position and recording procedures with a goniometer. Sagittal plane extension, flexion, and overall ROM were measured dynamically and passively. A two-way mixed model analysis of variance determined significant differences between groups and between passive and dynamic ROM (α = 0.05). Pearson correlations determined relationships between passive and dynamic ROM. Significant group by ROM interactions were found for flexion and extension ROM (p < 0.05). For extension, the severe OA group had less dynamic and passive ROM compared to the other groups and greater passive than dynamic ROM (p < 0.05). For flexion, significant differences in passive ROM existed between all three groups (p < 0.05) whereas no differences were found for dynamic flexion (p < 0.05). Significant correlations between dynamic and passive hip extension were found in the moderate (r = 0.596) and severe OA (r = 0.586) groups, and no correlation was found in the asymptomatic group (r = 0.139). Passive ROM explains variance in dynamic ROM measurements obtained during gait in individuals with moderate and severe hip OA which have implications for the design of treatment strategies targeting walking pathomechanics. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The literature suggest that myofascial trigger points should be considered peripheral pain generators and this critical review will summarize recent findings concerning the clinical evaluation and the treatment of myofascial trigger points.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The clinical features of myofascial trigger points and their contribution to the patient pain and disability have been detailed in several recent studies, which support the clinical relevance of the condition. Recent studies reported that manual palpation to identify MTrPs has good reliability, although some limitations are intrinsic to the diagnostic criteria. During the last decade, a plethora of treatments have been proposed and positive effects on pain and function demonstrated.\nSUMMARY: The myofascial trigger point phenomenon has good face validity and is clinically relevant. Clinicians are encouraged to consider the contribution of myofascial trigger points to the patient's pain and disability through a careful medical history and a specific manual examination. Patients with myofascial trigger points will benefit from a multimodal treatment plan including dry needling and manual therapy techniques.

  {"id":"bergauerDiagnosticPotentialFluid2022","abstract":"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive, affective, and motor dysfunction. The main pathophysiological mechanisms are chronic neuroinflammation, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) accumulation and neurodegeneration. CTE is mostly caused by exposure to multiple mild traumatic brain injuries, placing people participating in, for example, high contact sports at increased risk. Currently, CTE can solely be diagnosed post mortem based on the spatial pattern of tau-accumulation. Herein, we review candidate imaging and molecular biomarkers for their sensitivity and specificity and we look whether these are sufficient for reliable ante mortem diagnosis. Of the imaging biomarkers, PET appears to have the best potential. Candidate fluid biomarkers consist of genes and proteins found in brain derived extracellular vesicles, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau levels. However, neither these biomarkers nor the imaging biomarkers have the discriminatory power to differentiate between CTE and other tauopathies, highlighting the need for further validation. Future research could incorporate machine learning methodologies to differentiate between the tau accumulation patterns detected by PET/fMRI in Alzheimer's and CTE patients. Additionally, proteomic and metabolomic profiling of CSF and plasma associated with chronic mild traumatic brain injuries could highlight potential biomarkers for identifying at risk patients.","author":[{"family":"Bergauer","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Osch","given":"Robin","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Elferen","given":"Silke","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Gyllvik","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Venkatesh","given":"Hrishikesh"},{"family":"Schreiber","given":"Rudy"}],"citation-key":"bergauerDiagnosticPotentialFluid2022","container-title":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & Pharmacotherapie","container-title-short":"Biomed Pharmacother","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112602","ISSN":"1950-6007","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"112602","PMID":"35062068","source":"PubMed","title":"The diagnostic potential of fluid and imaging biomarkers in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)","type":"article-journal","volume":"146"},

  {"id":"bornMultiDirectionalSprintTraining2016","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a repeated sprint training with multi-directional change-of-direction (COD) movements (RSmulti) compared to repeated shuttle sprints (RSS) on variables related to COD speed and reactive agility. Nineteen highly-trained male U15 soccer players were assigned into two groups performing either RSmulti or RSS. For both groups, each training session involved 20 repeated 15 s sprints interspersed with 30 s recovery. With RSmulti the COD movements were randomized and performed in response to a visual stimulus, while the RSS involved predefined 180° COD movements. Before and following the six training sessions, performance in the Illinois agility test (IAT), COD speed in response to a visual stimulus, 20 m linear sprint time and vertical jumping height were assessed. Both groups improved their performance in the IAT (p < 0.01, ES = 1.13; p = 0.01, ES = 0.55). The COD speed in response to a visual stimulus improved with the RSmulti (p < 0.01, ES = 1.03), but not the RSS (p = 0.46, ES = 0.28). No differences were found for 20 m sprint time (P=0.73, ES = 0.07; p = 0.14, ES = 0.28) or vertical jumping height (p = 0.46, ES = 0.11; p = 0.29, ES = 0.12) for the RSmulti and RSS, respectively. In conclusion, performance in the IAT improved with the RSmulti as well as RSS. With the RSmulti however, the COD movements are performed in response to a visual stimulus, which may result in specific adaptations that improve COD speed and reactive agility in young highly trained soccer players. Key pointsDuring soccer, the players perform repeated sprints involving multi-directional COD movements, while most of these turns and twists are not pre-planned but executed in response to an external stimulus, such as ball movement, several interacting opponents and changing game situations.Both groups improved performance in the IAT. With the RSmulti on the Speedcourt however, the COD movements are performed in response to a visual stimulus, which may result in specific adaptations that improve COD speed and reactive agility.The Speedcourt could serve as a valuable method to design and individualize specific conditioning drills for young highly-trained soccer players.","author":[{"family":"Born","given":"Dennis-Peter"},{"family":"Zinner","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Düking","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Sperlich","given":"Billy"}],"citation-key":"bornMultiDirectionalSprintTraining2016","container-title":"Journal of Sports Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"J Sports Sci Med","ISSN":"1303-2968","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"314-319","PMCID":"PMC4879446","PMID":"27274670","source":"PubMed","title":"Multi-Directional Sprint Training Improves Change-Of-Direction Speed and Reactive Agility in Young Highly Trained Soccer Players","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"collingsRiskFactorsLower2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Identifying risk factors for lower limb injury is an important step in developing injury risk reduction training and testing for player monitoring. Female athletes are distinct from male athletes, warranting separate investigation into risk factors.\nOBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature and synthesise the evidence for intrinsic risk factors for lower limb injury in female team field and court sports.\nMETHODS: Five online databases were searched from inception to April 2020. To be eligible for inclusion, studies were required to be a prospective study presenting intrinsic risk factors for lower limb injury in female team field or court sport athletes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality of Prognosis Studies tool.\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine studies, capturing 2902 lower limb injuries in 14,492 female athletes, and analysing 80 distinct factors met the inclusion criteria. Risk factors for any lower limb injury included greater body mass (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.24, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]  0.18-0.29), greater body mass index (BMI) (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI  0.05-040), older age (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI  0.09-0.31), greater star excursion balance test (SEBT) anterior reach distance (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI   0.12-0.24), and smaller single-leg hop distance (SMD = - 0.09, 95% CI  - 0.12 to - 0.06). Lower knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) increased the risk of knee injury. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors included prior ACL injury (odds ratio [OR] = 3.94, 95% CI  2.07-7.50), greater double-leg postural sway (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI   0.02-1.15), and greater body mass (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI  0.12-0.39). Ankle injury risk factors included smaller SEBT anterior reach distance (SMD = - 0.13, 95% CI  - 0.14 to - 0.13), greater single-leg hop distance asymmetry (OR = 3.67, 95% CI   1.42-9.45), and slower agility course time (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.88). Remaining factors were not associated with injury or had conflicting evidence.\nCONCLUSION: Prior injury, older age, greater body mass, and greater BMI are risk factors for lower limb injury in female athletes.

  {"id":"collinsEffectsFatigueAnticipation2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Unanticipated cutting tasks which do not allow for pre-planning of a movement have been reported to promote knee mechanics which may increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Fatigue has also been reported to have similar effects. Athletes must often perform unanticipated tasks when they are fatigued. Previous studies have reported that the effects of anticipation become more prominent as an athlete progresses through a fatigue protocol. However, the protocols previously utilized may not mimic the demands of sports participation.\nMETHODS: Three-dimensional knee joint kinematics and kinetics were collected from 13 female athletes while they performed a run-and-cut task, before and after completion of an intermittent shuttle run. Trials were further divided (pre-planned, unanticipated) to assess the effects of anticipation.\nFINDINGS: There were no significant interactions between the effects of fatigue and anticipation for the peak knee angles or moments of the knee joint in any plane. Subjects did demonstrate a 68% increase in their peak knee abduction angles following completion of the intermittent shuttle run. Anticipation also had a significant effect on the mechanics of the knee in all planes. Most notably, there was a 23% increase in peak knee abduction angles and a 33% increase in the peak internal knee adduction moments.\nINTERPRETATION: Both fatigue and anticipation promoted knee mechanics which are associated with an increased risk of knee injury. However, it does not appear that their effects combine when athletes are at a level of fatigue which is thought to reflect sports participation.","author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Almonroeder","given":"Thomas G."},{"family":"Ebersole","given":"Kyle T."},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Kristian M."}],"citation-key":"collinsEffectsFatigueAnticipation2016","container-title":"Clinical Biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)","container-title-short":"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","DOI":"10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2016.04.004","ISSN":"1879-1271","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"62-67","PMID":"27128767","source":"PubMed","title":"The effects of fatigue and anticipation on the mechanics of the knee during cutting in female athletes","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"csukaIL10LevelsCerebrospinal1999","abstract":"Controlling the extent of inflammatory responses following brain injury may be beneficial since posttraumatic intracranial inflammation has been associated with adverse outcome. In order to elucidate the potential role of anti-inflammatory mediators, the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was monitored in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 28 patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and compared to control samples. The pattern of IL-10 was analyzed with respect to the patterns of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in both fluids during a time period of up to 22 days. In parallel, the function/dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was monitored using the CSF-/serum-albumin quotient (Q(A)) and compared to intrathecal cytokine levels. Mean IL-10 concentration in CSF was elevated in 26 out of 28 TBI patients (range: 1.3-41.7 pg/ml) compared to controls (cut-off: 1.06 pg/ml), whereas only seven patients had elevated mean IL-10 concentration in serum (range: 5.4-23 pg/ml; cut-off: 5.14 pg/ml). The time course of IL-10 was similar in both fluids, showing a peak during the first days and a second, lower rise in the second week. Intrathecal IL-10 synthesis is hypothesized since CSF-IL-10 levels exceeded serum-IL-10 levels in most of the patients, IL-10-index (CSF/serum-IL-10/QA) was elevated in 23 individuals, and elevation of CSF-IL-10 showed to be independent from severe BBB dysfunction. Neither CSF nor serum IL-10 values correlated with the dysfunction of the BBB. IL-10, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 showed similar patterns in CSF over time, whereas rises of TNF-alpha corresponded to declines of IL-10 levels. Our results suggest that IL-10 is predominantly induced intrathecally after severe TBI where it may downregulate inflammatory events following traumatic brain damage.","author":[{"family":"Csuka","given":"E."},{"family":"Morganti-Kossmann","given":"M.

  {"id":"daneshvarPosttraumaticNeurodegenerationChronic2015","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity around the world. Concussive and subconcussive forms of closed-head injury due to impact or blast neurotrauma represent the most common types of TBI in civilian and military settings. It is becoming increasingly evident that TBI can lead to persistent, long-term debilitating effects, and in some cases, progressive neurodegeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The epidemiological literature suggests that a single moderate-to-severe TBI may be associated with accelerated neurodegeneration and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or motor neuron disease. However, the pathologic phenotype of these post-traumatic neurodegenerations is largely unknown and there may be pathobiological differences between post-traumatic disease and the corresponding sporadic disorder. By contrast, the pathology of CTE is increasingly well known and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of progressive brain atrophy and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary and glial tangles, dystrophic neurites, 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) neuronal and glial aggregates, microvasculopathy, myelinated axonopathy, neuroinflammation, and white matter degeneration. Clinically, CTE is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory deficits, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and most often progress slowly over decades. Although research on the long-term effects of TBI is advancing quickly, the incidence and prevalence of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and CTE are unknown. Critical knowledge gaps include elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms, identification of genetic risk factors, and clarification of relevant variables-including age at exposure to trauma, history of prior and subsequent head trauma, substance use, gender, stress, and comorbidities-all of which may contribute to risk profiles and the development of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and CTE.

During that time, the NCAA Injury Surveillance System has collected game and practice injury data for women's soccer across all 3 NCAA divisions.\nMAIN RESULTS: The rate of injury was more than 3 times higher in games than in practices (16.44 versus 5.23 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures, rate ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval = 3.1, 3.4, P < .01), and preseason practices had an injury rate that was more than 3 times greater than the rate for in-season practices (9.52 versus 2.91 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures, rate ratio = 3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.1, 3.5, P < .01). Approximately 70% of all game and practice injuries affected the lower extremities. Ankle ligament sprains (18.3%), knee internal derangements (15.9%), concussions (8.6%), and leg contusions (8.3%) accounted for a substantial portion of game injuries. Upper leg muscle-tendon strains (21.3%), ankle ligament sprains (15.3%), knee internal derangements (7.7%), and pelvis and hip muscle strains (7.6%) represented most of the practice injuries. Injuries were categorized as attributable to player contact, \"other contact\" (eg, contact with the ball, ground, or other object), or no contact. Player-to-player contact accounted for more than half of all game injuries (approximately 54%) but less than 20% of all practice injuries. The majority of practice injuries involved noncontact injury mechanisms. Knee internal derangements, ankle ligament sprains, and concussions were the leading game injuries that resulted in 10 or more days of time lost as a result of injury.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Ankle ligament sprains, knee internal derangements, and concussions are common injuries in women's soccer. Research efforts have focused on knee injuries and concussions in soccer, and further epidemiologic data are needed to determine if preventive strategies will help to alter the incidence of these injuries. Furthermore, the specific nature of the player contact leading to concussions and lower extremity injuries should be investigated. Preventive efforts should continue to focus on reducing knee injuries, ankle injuries, and concussions in women collegiate soccer players.","author":[{"family":"Dick","given":"Randall"},{"family":"Putukian","given":"Margot"},{"family":"Agel","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Todd A."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Stephen W."}],"citation-key":"dickDescriptiveEpidemiologyCollegiate2007","container-title":"Journal of Athletic Training","container-title-short":"J Athl Train","ISSN":"1938-162X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","page":"278-285","PMCID":"PMC1941298","PMID":"17710177","source":"PubMed","title":"Descriptive epidemiology of collegiate women's soccer injuries: National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance System, 1988-1989 through 2002-2003","title-short":"Descriptive epidemiology of collegiate women's soccer injuries","type":"article-journal","volume":"42"},

Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic consequence of this condition characterized by persistent memory impairment. In this study we present a series of non-alcoholic patients with WE. The purpose of this study was to analyze the predisposing factors in non-alcoholic patients with WE and emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment with thiamine supplementation.\nMETHODS: The clinical records of 6 cases with WE followed by gastrointestinal tract disease and/or surgery who were admitted to our Medical Faculty between 2012 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.\nRESULTS: The study included 3 men and 3 women in the age range of 24 to 55. All patients had gastrointestinal tract diseases and/or had undergone gastrointestinal surgeries, and were non-alcoholic. Vomiting, weight loss, and parenteral nutrition were the frequent precipitating factors. The classic triad of mental impairment, oculomotor alterations and gait ataxia was present in 4 of the 6 patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed typical signal alterations in the medial thalami, mammillary bodies and the periaqueductal region of patients in various degrees. Clinical improvement was seen in each patient after thiamine supplementation.\nDISCUSSION: Physicians should be aware of the predisposing factors and symptoms to prevent or optimize the management of this potentially devastating disease.

It has been suggested that myofascial trigger points take part in chronic pain conditions including primary headache disorders. The aim of this narrative review is to present an overview of the current imaging modalities used for the detection of myofascial trigger points and to review studies of myofascial trigger points in migraine and tension-type headache.\nFINDINGS: Different modalities have been used to assess myofascial trigger points including ultrasound, microdialysis, electromyography, infrared thermography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound is the most promising of these modalities and may be used to identify MTrPs if specific methods are used, but there is no precise description of a gold standard using these techniques, and they have yet to be evaluated in headache patients. Active myofascial trigger points are prevalent in migraine patients. Manual palpation can trigger migraine attacks. All intervention studies aiming at trigger points are positive, but this needs to be further verified in placebo-controlled environments. These findings may imply a causal bottom-up association, but studies of migraine patients with comorbid fibromyalgia syndrome suggest otherwise. Whether myofascial trigger points contribute to an increased migraine burden in terms of frequency and intensity is unclear. Active myofascial trigger points are prevalent in tension-type headache coherent with the hypothesis that peripheral mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of this headache disorder. Active myofascial trigger points in pericranial muscles in tension-type headache patients are correlated with generalized lower pain pressure thresholds indicating they may contribute to a central sensitization. However, the number of active myofascial trigger points is higher in adults compared with adolescents regardless of no significant association with headache parameters. This suggests myofascial trigger points are accumulated over time as a consequence of TTH rather than contributing to the pathophysiology.\nCONCLUSIONS: Myofascial trigger points are prevalent in both migraine and tension-type headache, but the role they play in the pathophysiology of each disorder and to which degree is unclarified. In the future, ultrasound elastography may be an acceptable diagnostic test.","author":[{"family":"Do","given":"Thien Phu"},{"family":"Heldarskard","given":"Gerda Ferja"},{"family":"Kolding","given":"Lærke Tørring"},{"family":"Hvedstrup","given":"Jeppe"},{"family":"Schytz","given":"Henrik Winther"}],"citation-key":"doMyofascialTriggerPoints2018","container-title":"The Journal of Headache and Pain","container-title-short":"J Headache Pain","DOI":"10.1186/s10194-018-0913-8","ISSN":"1129-2377","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"84","PMCID":"PMC6134706","PMID":"30203398","source":"PubMed","title":"Myofascial trigger points in migraine and tension-type headache","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

A one-shot case study design was selected for this investigation. Seventeen female college athletes volunteered to participate. Right and left foot reaction time measurements were assessed using 3×4 switch mats interfaced with a precise timing counter. Participants stood in front of the mat with eyes closed and responded to the auditory stimulus by touching the mat as fast as possible with their foot. Two trials were conducted per foot, and the best time was used to determine the reaction time score per foot. An isokinetic dynamometer assessed inversion and eversion peak torque for both right and left ankle joint at 120°/sec. Left peak torque eversion and right foot reaction time demonstrated a significant negative moderate relationship (r = -0.530; p value = 0.03). Left ankle peak torque eversion does have a significant moderate negative relationship to reaction time of the right foot; therefore, evasive dribbling movements which requires inversion and eversion torque could directly affect foot reaction time, resulting in improved dribbling performance for soccer athletes.","author":[{"family":"Feehan","given":"Maggie X."},{"family":"Shim","given":"Andrew L."},{"family":"Cesar","given":"Guilherme M."},{"family":"Burggraff","given":"Amy M."}],"citation-key":"feehanThereRelationshipFoot2022","container-title":"International Journal of Exercise Science","container-title-short":"Int J Exerc Sci","ISSN":"1939-795X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"eng","page":"1506-1513","PMCID":"PMC9797005","PMID":"36620327","source":"PubMed","title":"Is There a Relationship Between Foot Reaction Time and Ankle Frontal Plane Torque in Female Soccer Athletes?

  {"id":"fengExtracellularMatrixDisc2006","abstract":"The extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc structures contains many molecules also found in cartilage. The extremely polyanionic proteoglycans play a central role, particularly in the nucleus, by creating an osmotic environment leading to retention of water and ensuing resistance to deformation-important for the resilience of the tissue. Another major structural entity particularly important in the anulus is the network of collagen fibers; fibril-forming collagen 1 is a major constituent. The collagen fibrils in the anulus are largely oriented in sheets around the nucleus. A number of molecules present in the matrix regulate and direct the collagen fibril assembly by interacting with the collagen molecule and also the formed fibril. Several of these molecules bind by one domain to the collagen fiber and present another functional domain to interact either with other fibers or with other matrix constituents. In this manner the collagen fibers are cross-linked into a network that provides tensile strength and distributes load over large parts of the anulus. Diminished function in these cross-bridging molecules will lead to loss of mechanical properties of the collagen network and result in an impaired ability of the anulus to resist forces delivered by compression of the disc and particularly the nucleus. A different network abundant in the disc and in other load-bearing tissues is based on the beaded filaments of collagen 6. The basic building block is a tetramer of two pairs of antiparallel collagen-6 molecules arranged such that two N-terminal ends of collagen 6 are exposed at either end of the unit. Further assembly occurs both by end-to-end and side-to-side associations. This process is catalyzed by both biglycan and decorin, where the combined effect of direct binding of the core protein to the collagen-6 N-terminal globular domain and the presence of the glycosaminoglycan side chain is essential. These ligands are bound at the same site in complexes extracted from the tissue and then also have one bound molecule of matrilin-1, 2, or 3, in turn bound to a collagen fiber, a procollagen molecule, or an aggrecan. Interactions at the cell surface provide signals to the cells with regard to the conditions of the matrix. Such interactions include binding by matrix components to various receptors at the cell surface. Remodeling of the matrix takes place in response to various factors. An early event in disease is degradation of aggrecan by the members of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) family and degradation of molecules important in maintaining the collagen network.","author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Danfelter","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Strömqvist","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Heinegård","given":"Dick"}],"citation-key":"fengExtracellularMatrixDisc2006","container-title":"The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

  {"id":"flackReviewAnatomyHip2012","abstract":"The hip abductor muscles have the capability to contribute to numerous actions, including pelvic stabilization during gait, and abduction and rotation at the hip joint. To fully understand the role of these muscles, as well as their involvement in hip joint dysfunction, knowledge of their anatomical structure is essential. The clinical literature suggests anatomical diversity within these muscles, and that gluteus medius (GMed) and gluteus minimus (GMin), in particular, may be comprised of compartments. This systematic review of the English literature focuses on the gross anatomy of GMed, GMin, and tensor fascia lata (TFL) muscles. Although studies of this muscle group have generated useful descriptions, comparison of results is hindered by methodological limitations. Furthermore, there is no single comprehensive anatomical investigation of all three muscles. Several aspects of the morphology of attachment sites are unknown or unclear. There is little data on fascicle orientation, the interface between fascicles and tendons, and the specific patterning of the superior gluteal nerve. Consequently, the existence of anatomical compartmentalization within the hip abductor muscles is difficult to assess. Further research of the architecture and innervation of the hip abductor muscle group is required; a better understanding of the precise anatomy of these muscles should improve our understanding of their specific functions and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disorders affecting the hip joint.","author":[{"family":"Flack","given":"Natasha Amy May Sparks"},{"family":"Nicholson","given":"Helen D."},{"family":"Woodley","given":"Stephanie Jane"}],"citation-key":"flackReviewAnatomyHip2012","container-title":"Clinical Anatomy (New York, N.Y.)","container-title-short":"Clin Anat","DOI":"10.1002/ca.22004","ISSN":"1098-2353","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"697-708","PMID":"22109658","source":"PubMed","title":"A review of the anatomy of the hip abductor muscles, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"fongAnkledorsiflexionRangeMotion2011","abstract":"CONTEXT: A smaller amount of ankle-dorsiflexion displacement during landing is associated with less knee-flexion displacement and greater ground reaction forces, and greater ground reaction forces are associated with greater knee-valgus displacement. Additionally, restricted dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) is associated with greater knee-valgus displacement during landing and squatting tasks. Because large ground reaction forces and valgus displacement and limited knee-flexion displacement during landing are anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors, dorsiflexion ROM restrictions may be associated with a greater risk of ACL injury. However, it is unclear whether clinical measures of dorsiflexion ROM are associated with landing biomechanics.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate relationships between dorsiflexion ROM and landing biomechanics.\nDESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study.\nSETTING: Research laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five healthy, physically active volunteers.\nINTERVENTION(S): Passive dorsiflexion ROM was assessed under extended-knee and flexed-knee conditions. Landing biomechanics were assessed via an optical motion-capture system interfaced with a force plate.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Dorsiflexion ROM was measured in degrees using goniometry. Knee-flexion and knee-valgus displacements and vertical and posterior ground reaction forces were calculated during the landing task. Simple correlations were used to evaluate relationships between dorsiflexion ROM and each biomechanical variable.\nRESULTS: Significant correlations were noted between extended-knee dorsiflexion ROM and knee-flexion displacement (r  =  0.464, P  =  .029) and vertical (r  =  -0.411, P  =  .014) and posterior (r  =  -0.412, P  =  .014) ground reaction forces. All correlations for flexed-knee dorsiflexion ROM and knee-valgus displacement were nonsignificant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Greater dorsiflexion ROM was associated with greater knee-flexion displacement and smaller ground reaction forces during landing, thus inducing a landing posture consistent with reduced ACL injury risk and limiting the forces the lower extremity must absorb. These findings suggest that clinical techniques to increase plantar-flexor extensibility and dorsiflexion ROM may be important additions to ACL injury-prevention programs.","author":[{"family":"Fong","given":"Chun-Man"},{"family":"Blackburn","given":"J.

  {"id":"hechtCrosssectionalExaminationUltraprocessed2022","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether individuals who consume higher amounts of ultra-processed food (UPF) have more adverse mental health symptoms.\nDESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the consumption of UPF as a percentage of total energy intake in kilo-calories using the NOVA food classification system. We explored whether individuals who consume higher amounts of UPF were more likely to report mild depression, more mentally unhealthy days and more anxious days per month using multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounding variables.\nSETTING: Representative sample from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2012.\nPARTICIPANTS: 10 359 adults aged 18+ without a history of cocaine, methamphetamine or heroin use.\nRESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, individuals with the highest level of UPF consumption were significantly more likely to report at least mild depression (OR: 1·81; 95 % CI1·09, 3·02), more mentally unhealthy (risk ratio (RR): 1·22; 95 % CI 1·18, 1·25) and more anxious days per month (RR: 1·19; 95 % CI 1·16, 1·23).

It is important to determine the economic effect of these injuries in order to document the public health burden in the United States.\nPURPOSE: To describe the cost of outpatient arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and health care utilization among commercially insured beneficiaries in the United States.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 3.\nMETHODS: The study used the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database, an administrative claims database that contains a large sample (approximately 148 million) of privately insured individuals aged <65 years and enrolled in employer-sponsored plans. All claims with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 29888 (arthroscopically aided ACL reconstruction or augmentation) from 2005 to 2013 were included. \"Immediate procedure\" cost was computed assuming a 3-day window of care centered on date of surgery. \"Total health care utilization\" cost was computed using a 9-month window of care (3 months preoperative and 6 months postoperative).\nRESULTS: There were 229,446 outpatient arthroscopic ACL reconstructions performed over the 9-year study period. Median immediate procedure cost was $9399.49. Median total health care utilization cost was $13,403.38. Patients who underwent concomitant collateral ligament (medial [MCL], lateral [LCL]) repair or reconstruction had the highest costs for both immediate procedure ($12,473.24) and health care utilization ($17,006.34). For patients who had more than 1 reconstruction captured in the database, total health care utilization costs were higher for the second procedure than the first procedure ($16,238.43 vs $15,000.36), despite the fact that immediate procedure costs were lower for second procedures ($8685.73 vs $9445.26).\nCONCLUSION: These results provide a foundation for understanding the public health burden of ACL injuries in the United States. Our findings suggest that further research on the prevention and treatment of ACL injuries is necessary to reduce this burden.","author":[{"family":"Herzog","given":"Mackenzie M."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Stephen W."},{"family":"Lund","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Pate","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Spang","given":"Jeffrey T."}],"citation-key":"herzogCostOutpatientArthroscopic2017","container-title":"Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine","container-title-short":"Orthop J Sports Med","DOI":"10.1177/2325967116684776","ISSN":"2325-9671","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"2325967116684776","PMCID":"PMC5302102","PMID":"28210655","source":"PubMed","title":"Cost of Outpatient Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Among Commercially Insured Patients in the United States, 2005-2013","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

Currently, there are no standardized treatment protocols to guide physical therapy interventions for this population. The purpose of this case series was to describe the unique, multimodal evaluation and treatment approaches for each of the patients with post-concussion syndrome (PCS).\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Six pediatric athletes with PCS who had participated in physical therapy and fit the inclusion criteria for review were retrospectively chosen for analysis. Patients received a cervical evaluation, an aerobic activity assessment, an oculomotor screen, and postural control assessment. Each patient participated in an individualized physical therapy treatment plan-of-care based on their presentation during the evaluation.\nOUTCOMES: Patients were treated for a mean of 6.8 treatment sessions over 9.8 weeks. Four of six patients returned to their pre-injury level of activity while two returned to modified activity upon completion of physical therapy. Improvements were observed in symptom scores, gaze stability, balance and postural control measures, and patient self-management of symptoms. All patients demonstrated adequate self-management of symptoms upon discharge from physical therapy.\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapy interventions for pediatric athletes with PCS may facilitate recovery and improve function.

Here, we assess global evidence linking sleep disturbance, sleep duration, and inflammation in adult humans.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of English language publications was performed, with inclusion of primary research articles that characterized sleep disturbance and/or sleep duration or performed experimental sleep deprivation and assessed inflammation by levels of circulating markers. Effect sizes (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled using a random effect model.\nRESULTS: A total of 72 studies (n > 50,000) were analyzed with assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Sleep disturbance was associated with higher levels of CRP (ES .12; 95% CI = .05-.19) and IL-6 (ES .20; 95% CI = .08-.31). Shorter sleep duration, but not the extreme of short sleep, was associated with higher levels of CRP (ES .09; 95% CI = .01-.17) but not IL-6 (ES .03; 95% CI: -.09 to .14).

  {"id":"jaumardSpinalFacetJoint2011","abstract":"The facet joint is a crucial anatomic region of the spine owing to its biomechanical role in facilitating articulation of the vertebrae of the spinal column. It is a diarthrodial joint with opposing articular cartilage surfaces that provide a low friction environment and a ligamentous capsule that encloses the joint space. Together with the disc, the bilateral facet joints transfer loads and guide and constrain motions in the spine due to their geometry and mechanical function. Although a great deal of research has focused on defining the biomechanics of the spine and the form and function of the disc, the facet joint has only recently become the focus of experimental, computational and clinical studies. This mechanical behavior ensures the normal health and function of the spine during physiologic loading but can also lead to its dysfunction when the tissues of the facet joint are altered either by injury, degeneration or as a result of surgical modification of the spine. The anatomical, biomechanical and physiological characteristics of the facet joints in the cervical and lumbar spines have become the focus of increased attention recently with the advent of surgical procedures of the spine, such as disc repair and replacement, which may impact facet responses. Accordingly, this review summarizes the relevant anatomy and biomechanics of the facet joint and the individual tissues that comprise it. In order to better understand the physiological implications of tissue loading in all conditions, a review of mechanotransduction pathways in the cartilage, ligament and bone is also presented ranging from the tissue-level scale to cellular modifications. With this context, experimental studies are summarized as they relate to the most common modifications that alter the biomechanics and health of the spine-injury and degeneration. In addition, many computational and finite element models have been developed that enable more-detailed and specific investigations of the facet joint and its tissues than are provided by experimental approaches and also that expand their utility for the field of biomechanics. These are also reviewed to provide a more complete summary of the current knowledge of facet joint mechanics. Overall, the goal of this review is to present a comprehensive review of the breadth and depth of knowledge regarding the mechanical and adaptive responses of the facet joint and its tissues across a variety of relevant size scales.","author":[{"family":"Jaumard","given":"Nicolas V."},{"family":"Welch","given":"William C."},{"family":"Winkelstein","given":"Beth A."}],"citation-key":"jaumardSpinalFacetJoint2011","container-title":"Journal of Biomechanical Engineering","container-title-short":"J Biomech Eng","DOI":"10.1115/1.4004493","ISSN":"1528-8951","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"071010","PMCID":"PMC3705911","PMID":"21823749","source":"PubMed","title":"Spinal facet joint biomechanics and mechanotransduction in normal, injury and degenerative conditions","type":"article-journal","volume":"133"},

Because interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important mediator of these pathophysiological changes, IL-6 levels were monitored in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 20 patients with severe isolated TBI. All patients received indwelling ventricular catheters for intracranial pressure monitoring and for release of CSF when intracranial pressure exceeded 15 mmHg. CSF and blood samples were drawn daily for up to 14 days. The CSF/serum albumin ratio (QA) served as a parameter of blood brain barrier dysfunction. Differential blood counts as well as the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen were recorded. IL-6 was detected in all CSF samples and reached values of up to 31,000 pg/mL, while serum levels remained significantly lower (alpha < or = .01) and never exceeded 1,100 pg/mL the entire study period. A correlation between CSF and serum IL-6 was found initially after the trauma and corresponded to a severe dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (r = .637, p = .001). Maximum IL-6 concentrations in serum correlated with peak levels of acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen). With regard to blood cell count, an initial leukocytosis combined with a borderline lymphocytopenia was observed. Thrombocytes decreased to a subnormal level during the first few days, but reached supranormal numbers by the end of the study period. Our results show that the increase of IL-6 levels in CSF and serum is followed by a profound acute-phase response in patients with TBI. Because cytokine concentrations are significantly lower in serum compared with CSF, we hypothesize that IL-6 produced in the central nervous system may play a role in initiating the acute-phase response.","author":[{"family":"Kossmann","given":"T."},{"family":"Hans","given":"V.

These data identify a small area of high acetabular and femoral head stress that could occur during each of a human's millions of gait cycles annually and indicate that muscle activity, rather than solely body weight, drives hip loading, Clinicians who desire to limit hip loads should reduce both hip muscle contraction and weight bearing in late stance.","author":[{"family":"Krebs","given":"D.

Male and female adolescent athletes (age 13-18 years) presenting within 10 days of SRC were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise or a placebo-like stretching regimen.\nINTERVENTIONS: After systematic determination of treadmill exercise tolerance on the first visit, participants were randomly assigned to a progressive subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise or a progressive placebo-like stretching program (that would not substantially elevate heart rate). Both forms of exercise were performed approximately 20 minutes per day, and participants reported daily symptoms and compliance with exercise prescription via a website.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Days from injury to recovery; recovery was defined as being asymptomatic, having recovery confirmed through an assessment by a physician blinded to treatment group, and returning to normal exercise tolerance on treadmill testing. Participants were also classified as having normal (<30 days) or delayed (≥30 days) recovery.\nRESULTS: A total of 103 participants were included (aerobic exercise: n = 52; 24 female [46%]; stretching, n = 51; 24 female [47%]). Participants in the aerobic exercise group were seen a mean (SD) of 4.9 (2.2) days after the SRC, and those in the stretching group were seen a mean (SD) of 4.8 (2.4) days after the SRC. There were no differences in age, sex, previous concussions, time from injury, initial symptom severity score, or initial exercise treadmill test and physical examination results. Aerobic exercise participants recovered in a median of 13 (interquartile range [IQR], 10-18.5) days, whereas stretching participants recovered in 17 (IQR, 13-23) days (P = .009 by Mann-Whitney test). There was a nonsignificant lower incidence of delayed recovery in the aerobic exercise group (2 participants [4%] in the aerobic group vs 7 [14%] in the placebo group; P = .08).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT to show that individualized subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise treatment prescribed to adolescents with concussion symptoms during the first week after SRC speeds recovery and may reduce the incidence of delayed recovery.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02710123.","author":[{"family":"Leddy","given":"John J."},{"family":"Haider","given":"Mohammad N."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Mannix","given":"Rebekah"},{"family":"Darling","given":"Scott R."},{"family":"Freitas","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Suffoletto","given":"Heidi N."},{"family":"Leiter","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Cordingley","given":"Dean M."},{"family":"Willer","given":"Barry"}],"citation-key":"leddyEarlySubthresholdAerobic2019","container-title":"JAMA pediatrics","container-title-short":"JAMA Pediatr","DOI":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.4397","ISSN":"2168-6211","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"319-325","PMCID":"PMC6450274","PMID":"30715132","source":"PubMed","title":"Early Subthreshold Aerobic Exercise for Sport-Related Concussion: A Randomized Clinical Trial","title-short":"Early Subthreshold Aerobic Exercise for Sport-Related Concussion","type":"article-journal","volume":"173"},
  {"id":"liaoTransformationNeuroprotectiveNeurotoxic2012","abstract":"Neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological feature in the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in transgenic mouse models of inherited ALS, and is characterized by activated microglia. Earlier studies showed that activated microglia play important roles in both motoneuron protection and injury. More recent studies investigating the pathoprogression of disease in ALS mice have demonstrated that the in vivo activation states of microglia, including their anti- versus pro-inflammatory responses, are best characterized as a continuum between two extreme activation states which are represented as a neuroprotective M2 (alternatively-activated) phenotypic state or an injurious/toxic M1 (classically-activated) state; a more complete understanding and determination the temporal transformation of microglia activation states in the ALS disease pathoprogression is therefore warranted. In the current study, we demonstrated a phenotypic and functional transformation of adult ALS mice microglia that overexpress mutant superoxide dismutase (mSOD1). mSOD1 microglia isolated from ALS mice at disease onset expressed higher levels of Ym1, CD163 and BDNF (markers of M2) mRNA and lower levels of Nox2 (a marker of M1) mRNA compared with mSOD1 microglia isolated from ALS mice at end-stage disease. More importantly, when co-cultured with motoneurons, these mSOD1 M2 microglia were neuroprotective and enhanced motoneuron survival than similarly co-cultured mSOD1 M1 microglia; end-stage mSOD1 M1 microglia were toxic to motoneurons. Our study documents that adult microglia isolated from ALS mice at disease onset have an M2 phenotype and protect motoneurons whereas microglia isolated from end-stage disease ALS mice have adopted an M1 phenotype and are neurotoxic supporting the dual phenotypes of microglia and their transformation during disease pathoprogression in these mice. Thus, harnessing the neuroprotective potential of microglia may provide novel avenues for ALS therapies.","author":[{"family":"Liao","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Weihua"},{"family":"Beers","given":"David R."},{"family":"Henkel","given":"Jenny S."},{"family":"Appel","given":"Stanley H."}],"citation-key":"liaoTransformationNeuroprotectiveNeurotoxic2012","container-title":"Experimental Neurology","container-title-short":"Exp Neurol","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.06.011","ISSN":"1090-2430","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"147-152","PMCID":"PMC4126417","PMID":"22735487","source":"PubMed","title":"Transformation from a neuroprotective to a neurotoxic microglial phenotype in a mouse model of ALS","type":"article-journal","volume":"237"},
  {"id":"liLumbarFacetJoint2011","abstract":"STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of lumbar degenerative disc diseases (DDDs) on motion of the facet joints during functional weight-bearing activities.\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It has been suggested that DDD adversely affects the biomechanical behavior of the facet joints. Altered facet joint motion, in turn, has been thought to associate with various types of lumbar spine pathology including facet degeneration, neural impingement, and DDD progression. However, to date, no data have been reported on the motion patterns of the lumbar facet joint in DDD patients.\nMETHODS: Ten symptomatic patients of DDD at L4-S1 were studied. Each participant underwent magnetic resonance images to obtain three-dimensional models of the lumbar vertebrae (L2-S1) and dual fluoroscopic imaging during three characteristic trunk motions: left-right torsion, left-right bending, and flexion-extension. In vivo positions of the vertebrae were reproduced by matching the three-dimensional models of the vertebrae to their outlines on the fluoroscopic images. The kinematics of the facet joints and the ranges of motion (ROMs) were compared with a group of healthy participants reported in a previous study.\nRESULTS: In facet joints of the DDD patients, there was no predominant axis of rotation and no difference in ROMs was found between the different levels. During left-right torsion, the ROMs were similar between the DDD patients and the healthy participants. During left-right bending, the rotation around mediolateral axis at L4-L5, in the DDD patients, was significantly larger than that of the healthy participants. During flexion-extension, the rotations around anterioposterior axis at L4-L5 and around craniocaudal axis at the adjacent level (L3-L4), in the DDD patients, were also significantly larger, whereas the rotation around mediolateral axis at both L2-L3 and L3-L4 levels in the DDD patients were significantly smaller than those of the healthy participants.\nCONCLUSION: DDD alters the ROMs of the facet joints. The rotations can increase significantly not only at the DDD levels but also at their adjacent levels when compared to those of the healthy participants. The increase in rotations did not occur around the primary rotation axis of the torso motion but around the coupled axes. This hypermobility in coupled rotations might imply a biomechanical mechanism related to DDD.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Weishi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shaobai"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Qun"},{"family":"Passias","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kozanek","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Kirkham"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guoan"}],"citation-key":"liLumbarFacetJoint2011","container-title":"Spine","container-title-short":"Spine (Phila Pa 1976)","DOI":"10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181faaef7","ISSN":"1528-1159","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"E629-637","PMCID":"PMC3740386","PMID":"21270686","source":"PubMed","title":"Lumbar facet joint motion in patients with degenerative disc disease at affected and adjacent levels: an in vivo biomechanical study","title-short":"Lumbar facet joint motion in patients with degenerative disc disease at affected and adjacent levels","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"linSexDifferencesCommon2018","abstract":"Common sports injuries include bone stress injuries (BSIs), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and concussions. Less commonly recognized are the specific sex differences in epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of these conditions by sex. An understanding of these factors can improve their clinical management, from prescribing appropriate prehabilitation to guiding postinjury rehabilitation and return to play. This narrative review summarizes the sex differences in the diagnosis and management of BSIs, ACL injuries, and concussions. Although BSIs are more common in female athletes, risk factors for both sexes include prior injury and relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). Risk factors in female athletes include smaller calf girth, femoral adduction, and higher rates of loading. Female athletes are also at greater risk for developing ACL injuries in high school and college, but their injury rate is similar in professional sports. Increased lateral tibial slope, smaller ACL size, and suboptimal landing mechanics are additional risk factors more often present in female athletes. Male athletes are more likely to have ACL surgery and have a higher rate of return to sport. Concussions occur more commonly in female athletes; however, female athletes are also more likely to report concussions. Male athletes more commonly sustain concussion through contact with another player. Female athletes more commonly sustain injury from contact with playing equipment. Managing post-concussion symptoms is important, and female athletes may have prolonged symptoms. An understanding of the sex-specific differences in these common sports injuries can help optimize their prehabilitation and rehabilitation.

Epidemiologic studies can help describe disease burden and examine its potential risk factors, providing thereby evidence base for future mechanistic studies. With this review, we aimed to provide a summary of epidemiologic studies published during the past 18 months, which studied the incidence and risk factors for ALS.\nRECENT FINDINGS: An increasing incidence and prevalence of ALS continue to be reported from different parts of the world. Several previously studied risk factors are confirmed as causally related to ALS by Mendelian randomization analysis. The previously known prognostic indicators for ALS appear to be the same across populations.\nSUMMARY: Provided with the increasing number of patients diagnosed with ALS and the improved societal awareness of the disease, more resources should be allocated to the research and care of ALS. Population-based studies, especially population-based disease registers, should be the priorities in ALS research, and more data from outside Europe are needed in gaining a better global perspective of the disease.","author":[{"family":"Longinetti","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Fang"}],"citation-key":"longinettiEpidemiologyAmyotrophicLateral2019","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurology","container-title-short":"Curr Opin Neurol","DOI":"10.1097/WCO.0000000000000730","ISSN":"1473-6551","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"771-776","PMCID":"PMC6735526","PMID":"31361627","source":"PubMed","title":"Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: an update of recent literature","title-short":"Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

The study involved 36 individual (sprint, hurdles, jumping, tennis, and judo) and 34 team (soccer, basketball, and handball) athletes. CODS and RA were measured with a light-based reactive training system in a frontal (FR), universal (UN), semicircular (SC), and lateral (LA) design. Lower limb power and sprint performance were also measured in a 10 m single leg jump test and 15 m sprint. Individual athletes showed significantly better performance in three of the eight agility tests: LA-RA, UN-RA, and SC-CODS (p < 0.008, p < 0.036, and p < 0.027, respectively) and were found to present stronger correlations (p < 0.01) between jump test performance and the CODS condition. Team athletes showed stronger associations between sprint performance and the CODS condition. In the RA condition both jump and sprint performance showed stronger correlations in the group of individual athletes. Agility performance as measured by CODS and RA should improve with enhanced of motor proficiency. Finally, the tests applied in this experiment seem to be multidimensional, but require spatio-temporal adjustment for their implementation, so that they meet the requirements of the particular sport.","author":[{"family":"Mackala","given":"Krzysztof"},{"family":"Vodičar","given":"Janez"},{"family":"Žvan","given":"Milan"},{"family":"Križaj","given":"Jožef"},{"family":"Stodolka","given":"Jacek"},{"family":"Rauter","given":"Samo"},{"family":"Čoh","given":"Milan"}],"citation-key":"mackalaEvaluationPrePlannedNonPlaned2020","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph17030975","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"975","PMCID":"PMC7037819","PMID":"32033236","source":"PubMed","title":"Evaluation of the Pre-Planned and Non-Planed Agility Performance: Comparison between Individual and Team Sports","title-short":"Evaluation of the Pre-Planned and Non-Planed Agility Performance","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"manciniRiskAnteriorCruciate2021","abstract":"Soccer is becoming an increasingly popular sport amongst women. Common movements during play, such as jumping and cutting, require rapid acceleration and deceleration of multiple lower-limb joints. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which contributes to stabilization of the knee, is often injured during these events. ACL injury typically requires costly surgery, extended time away from sports, and jeopardizes long-term joint health. Due to sex-specific factors such as menstruation and anatomical disadvantages, women are more susceptible to tearing their ACL. Injury often occurs in non-contact scenarios during rapid acceleration or deceleration movements. Research has examined these movements and established several kinematic and kinetic mechanisms as well as muscle activation patterns that frequently occur at the time of injury, however results tend to vary based on population. This article summarizes recent and relevant literature of ACL injury mechanisms and highlights the lack of specific research in the high-risk female soccer athlete population. Due to inconclusive risk factors, injury prevention programs within this population have been inconsistent. ACL injury risk for female soccer athletes should be closer examined so that more specific injury risks can be established, and effective protective measures can be taken. Raised awareness of this need may capture attention in the research and medical communities and potentially stimulate the development of strategies that limit future ACL injury and thus the challenges it brings to the high-risk female soccer athlete.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mancini","given":"Sophia L."},{"family":"Dickin","given":"Clark"},{"family":"Hankemeier","given":"Dorice A."},{"family":"Rolston","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Henry"}],"citation-key":"manciniRiskAnteriorCruciate2021","container-title":"Journal of Orthopedics and Orthopedic Surgery","container-title-short":"J Orthopedics & Orthopedic Surg","DOI":"10.29245/2767-5130/2021/1.1128","ISSN":"27675130","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"page":"13-21","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Athletes: A Review","title-short":"Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Athletes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.orthojournal.org/articles/risk-of-anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury-in-female-soccer-athletes-a-review.html","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"martinMechanismsNeuronalDegeneration2000","abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also referred to as motor neurone disease, is a fatal neurological disease that is characterized clinically by progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and eventual paralysis. The neuropathology of ALS is primary degeneration of upper (motor cortical) and lower (brainstem and spinal) motor neurons. The amyotrophy refers to the neurogenic atrophy of affected muscle groups, and the lateral sclerosis refers to the hardening of the lateral white matter funiculus in spinal cord (corresponding to degeneration of the corticospinal tract) found at autopsy. Because the mechanisms for the motor neuron degeneration in ALS are not understood, this disease has no precisely known causes and no effective treatments. Very recent studies have identified that the degeneration of motor neurons in ALS is a form of apoptotic cell death that may occur by an abnormal programmed cell death (PCD) mechanism. In order to treat ALS effectively, we need to understand the mechanisms for motor neuron apoptosis more completely. Future studies need to further identify the signals for PCD activation in neurons as they relate to the pathogenesis of ALS and to clarify the molecular pathways leading to motor neuron apoptosis in animal and cell culture model systems. These studies should lead to a better understanding of motor neuron death and to the design of new therapeutic experiments critical for the future treatment of ALS.","author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"L.

  {"id":"mckeeSpectrumDiseaseChronic2013","abstract":"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a progressive tauopathy that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. We analysed post-mortem brains obtained from a cohort of 85 subjects with histories of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 68 subjects: all males, ranging in age from 17 to 98 years (mean 59.5 years), including 64 athletes, 21 military veterans (86% of whom were also athletes) and one individual who engaged in self-injurious head banging behaviour. Eighteen age- and gender-matched individuals without a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury served as control subjects. In chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the spectrum of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology ranged in severity from focal perivascular epicentres of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal neocortex to severe tauopathy affecting widespread brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe, thereby allowing a progressive staging of pathology from stages I-IV. Multifocal axonal varicosities and axonal loss were found in deep cortex and subcortical white matter at all stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive inclusions and neurites were also found in 85% of cases, ranging from focal pathology in stages I-III to widespread inclusions and neurites in stage IV. Symptoms in stage I chronic traumatic encephalopathy included headache and loss of attention and concentration. Additional symptoms in stage II included depression, explosivity and short-term memory loss. In stage III, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment were found, and in stage IV, dementia, word-finding difficulty and aggression were characteristic. Data on athletic exposure were available for 34 American football players; the stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy correlated with increased duration of football play, survival after football and age at death. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was the sole diagnosis in 43 cases (63%); eight were also diagnosed with motor neuron disease (12%), seven with Alzheimer's disease (11%), 11 with Lewy body disease (16%) and four with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (6%). There is an ordered and predictable progression of hyperphosphorylated tau abnormalities through the nervous system in chronic traumatic encephalopathy that occurs in conjunction with widespread axonal disruption and loss. The frequent association of chronic traumatic encephalopathy with other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that repetitive brain trauma and hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition promote the accumulation of other abnormally aggregated proteins including TAR DNA-binding protein 43, amyloid beta protein and alpha-synuclein.","author":[{"family":"McKee","given":"Ann C."},{"family":"Stern","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Nowinski","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Thor D."},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"Victor E."},{"family":"Daneshvar","given":"Daniel H."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hyo-Soon"},{"family":"Wojtowicz","given":"Sydney M."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Garth"},{"family":"Baugh","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Riley","given":"David O."},{"family":"Kubilus","given":"Caroline A."},{"family":"Cormier","given":"Kerry A."},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Brett R."},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Carmela R."},{"family":"Ikezu","given":"Tsuneya"},{"family":"Reichard","given":"Robert Ross"},{"family":"Wolozin","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Budson","given":"Andrew E."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Lee E."},{"family":"Kowall","given":"Neil W."},{"family":"Cantu","given":"Robert C."}],"citation-key":"mckeeSpectrumDiseaseChronic2013","container-title":"Brain: A Journal of Neurology","container-title-short":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/aws307","ISSN":"1460-2156","issue":"Pt 1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"43-64","PMCID":"PMC3624697","PMID":"23208308","source":"PubMed","title":"The spectrum of disease in chronic traumatic encephalopathy","type":"article-journal","volume":"136"},

Moreover, emerging evidence linking repeated mild traumatic brain injury to long-term neurodegenerative disorders points out that TBI can be both an acute disorder and a chronic disease. We are at an important transition point in our understanding of TBI, as past work has generated significant advances in better protecting us against some forms of moderate and severe TBI. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how to study milder forms of injury, such as concussion, or new forms of TBI that can occur from primary blast loading.

Studies were included if they were peer reviewed and published in English, included participants who were involved in sport or deemed physically active, compared CWI with passive recovery methods following an acute bout of strenuous exercise and included athletic performance, athlete perception and CK outcome measures. Studies were divided into two strenuous exercise subgroups: eccentric exercise and high-intensity exercise. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. Meta-regression analyses were completed with water temperature and exposure durations as continuous moderator variables.\nRESULTS: Fifty-two studies were included in the meta-analyses. CWI improved the recovery of muscular power 24 h after eccentric exercise (SMD 0.34 [95% CI 0.06-0.62]) and after high-intensity exercise (SMD 0.22 [95% CI 0.004-0.43]), and reduced serum CK (SMD - 0.85 [95% CI - 1.61 to - 0.08]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. CWI also improved muscle soreness (SMD - 0.89 [95% CI - 1.48 to - 0.29]) and perceived feelings of recovery (SMD 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.03]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. There was no significant influence on the recovery of strength performance following either eccentric or high-intensity exercise. Meta-regression indicated that shorter time and lower temperatures were related to the largest beneficial effects on serum CK (duration and temperature dose effects) and endurance performance (duration dose effects only) after high-intensity exercise.\nCONCLUSION: CWI was an effective recovery tool after high-intensity exercise, with positive outcomes occurring for muscular power, muscle soreness, CK, and perceived recovery 24 h after exercise. However, after eccentric exercise, CWI was only effective for positively influencing muscular power 24 h after exercise. Dose-response relationships emerged for positively influencing endurance performance and reducing serum CK, indicating that shorter durations and lower temperatures may improve the efficacy of CWI if used after high-intensity exercise.\nFUNDING: Emma Moore is supported by a Research Training Program (Domestic) Scholarship from the Australian Commonwealth Department of Education and Training.\nPROTOCOL REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework: 10.17605/OSF.IO/SRB9D.","author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Joel T."},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Siena"},{"family":"Halson","given":"Shona L."},{"family":"Broatch","given":"James R."},{"family":"Bellenger","given":"Clint R."}],"citation-key":"mooreImpactColdWaterImmersion2022","container-title":"Sports Medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","container-title-short":"Sports Med","DOI":"10.1007/s40279-022-01644-9","ISSN":"1179-2035","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"1667-1688","PMCID":"PMC9213381","PMID":"35157264","source":"PubMed","title":"Impact of Cold-Water Immersion Compared with Passive Recovery Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis and Meta-regression","title-short":"Impact of Cold-Water Immersion Compared with Passive Recovery Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},
  {"id":"morganti-kossmannTGFbetaElevatedCSF1999","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces local and systemic immunologic changes, release of cytokines, and cell activation. Perpetuation of these cascades may contribute to secondary damage to the brain. Therefore, the ability of the antiinflammatory mediator transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) to downregulate intrathecal immunoactivation may be of fundamental value for diminishing the incidence and extent of secondary insults. In this study, the release of TGF-beta into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 22 patients with severe TBI was analyzed with respect to the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for 21 days. Levels of TGF-beta in CSF increased to their maximum on the first day (median, 1.26 ng/mL), thereafter decreasing gradually over time. Median TGF-beta values in serum always remained within the reference interval (6.5 to 71.5 ng/mL). Daily assessment of the CSF-serum albumin quotient (QA) and of the CSF-serum TGF-beta quotient (QTGF-beta) showed a strong correlation between maximal QTGF-beta and QA, indicating a passage of this cytokine from the periphery to the intrathecal compartment across the BBB. However, calculation of the TGF-beta index (QTGF-beta/Q(A)) suggested a cerebral production of TGF-beta in 9 of 22 patients. Levels of TGF-beta could not be correlated with extent of initial injury by computed tomography (CT), CD4/CD8 ratios, acute lung injury, or clinical outcome as rated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Although increased levels of TGF-beta in CSF seem to parallel BBB function, a partial intrathecal production is suggested, possibly modulated by elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Thus, TGF-beta may function as a factor in the complex cytokine network following TBI, acting as an antiinflammatory and neuroprotective mediator.","author":[{"family":"Morganti-Kossmann","given":"M.

These muscles are innervated by C5-T1 spinal nerves. The spinal cord is divided into white columns (myelinated axons) and gray horns (cell bodies of motor neurons). The sensory neurons have their cell bodies in the posterior (dorsal) root ganglia. They have a peripheral process that innervates the organs of sensation in the skin and a central process that connects the posterior root ganglia to the spinal cord posterior (dorsal) columns for sensory function. The cell bodies for motor function lie in the anterior (ventral) gray horns. The posterior roots serve sensation. The anterior roots are motor in function. The posterior and anterior roots join to form the mixed spinal nerve. Those that serve the upper limb are derived from spinal cord segments C5-T1. The entirety of the spinal cord gives off eight cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral, and one coccygeal mixed spinal nerve. The mixed spinal nerves join to form the brachial plexus (Latin brachium = arm). The mixed spinal nerves give off posterior and anterior branches. The anterior branches from C5-T1 are termed roots of the brachial plexus. Those from C5 and C6 join to form the superior trunk. Those from C7 form the middle trunk. Those from C8 and T1 form the superior trunk. The posterior nerves are involved in the innervation of the paraspinal muscles. Each trunk then divides into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior divisions from C5, C6, and C7 join to form the lateral cord. Those from the anterior divisions of C8 and T1 form the medial cord. The posterior divisions of C5-T1 join to form the posterior cord. The median nerve is one of the five terminal divisions of the brachial plexus. The convergence of the lateral and the medial cords form this nerve, and it has contributions from all anterior rami of C5-T1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphy","given":"Kelly A."},{"family":"Morrisonponce","given":"Daphne"}],"call-number":"NBK448084","citation-key":"murphyAnatomyShoulderUpper2023","container-title":"StatPearls","event-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"eng","license":"Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.","PMID":"28846302","publisher":"StatPearls Publishing","publisher-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","source":"PubMed","title":"Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Median Nerve","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448084/"},

Both groups performed VMT, but the intervention group additionally underwent anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; F3). The cathodal electrode was positioned in the right supraorbital region (Fp2). The tDCS was applied at 2 mA for 20 min for five consecutive sessions (24 h intervals). The VMT protocol was delivered during the application of tDCS and was composed of kicking a ball for 10 min (between the fifth and fifteenth minutes of the 20 min of tDCS application). The primary outcome was assessed based on changes in CRT during reaching (non-trained limb) and kicking (trained limb) tasks. Secondary outcomes were overall cognitive function measured by the Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A) and part B (TMT-B), and Digit Span Test forward (DSF) and backward (DSB) scores.

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies published between January 1990 and June 2015.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Included literature must have addressed 1 of 9 predetermined clinical topics: (1) preoperative predictors for postoperative outcome, (2) effectiveness of physical therapy, (3) open and closed kinetic chain quadriceps exercises, (4) strength and neuromuscular training, (5) electrostimulation and electromyographic feedback, (6) cryotherapy, (7) measurements of functional performance, (8) return to play and (9) risk for reinjury.Summary Ninety studies were included as the basis for the evidence statement. Rehabilitation after ACL injury should include a prehabilitation phase and 3 criterion-based postoperative phases: (1) impairment-based, (2) sport-specific training and (3) return to play. A battery of strength and hop tests, quality of movement and psychological tests should be used to guide progression from one rehabilitation stage to the next. Postoperative rehabilitation should continue for 9–12 months. To assess readiness to return to play and the risk for reinjury, a test battery, including strength tests, hop tests and measurement of movement quality, should be used.","author":[{"literal":"Nicky van Melick"},{"literal":"Robert E H van Cingel"},{"literal":"Frans Brooijmans"},{"literal":"Camille Neeter"},{"literal":"Tony van Tienen"},{"literal":"Wim Hullegie"},{"literal":"Maria W G Nijhuis-van der Sanden"}],"citation-key":"nickyvanmelickEvidencebasedClinicalPractice2016","container-title":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","container-title-short":"Br J Sports Med","DOI":"10.1136/bjsports-2015-095898","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"page":"1506","title":"Evidence-based clinical practice update: practice guidelines for anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation based on a systematic review and multidisciplinary consensus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/24/1506.abstract","volume":"50"},

The information was filtered using the following Medical Subjects Heading (MeSH) terms: \"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", \"Physical Therapy\", and \"Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine\". The internal validity of the selected documents was evaluated using the PEDro scale. The study included clinical trials published in the last 5 years in which one of the interventions was therapeutic physical exercise in patients with ALS, using the ALSFRS-R as the main outcome variable and functional variables as secondary variables.\nRESULTS: 10 clinical trials were analyzed, with an internal validity of 5-7 points. The TFE groups showed significant short-, medium- and long-term differences, obtaining a mean difference of 5.8 points compared to the 7.6 points obtained by the control groups, at six months, measured with ALSFRS-R. In addition, the participants showed significant improvements in functional abilities in the short, medium and long terms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic physical exercise could contribute to slowing down the deterioration of the musculature of patients with ALS, thus facilitating their performance in activities of daily living, based on the significant differences shown by these individuals in the short, medium and long term both in subjective perception, measured with ALSFRS-R, and functional capacities.","author":[{"family":"Ortega-Hombrados","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Molina-Torres","given":"Guadalupe"},{"family":"Galán-Mercant","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Sánchez-Guerrero","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"González-Sánchez","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Ruiz-Muñoz","given":"María"}],"citation-key":"ortega-hombradosSystematicReviewTherapeutic2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph18031074","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"1074","PMCID":"PMC7908444","PMID":"33530383","source":"PubMed","title":"Systematic Review of Therapeutic Physical Exercise in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis over Time","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"osmotherlyRevisitingClinicalAnatomy2013","abstract":"PURPOSE: The morphology of the alar ligaments has been inconsistently described, particularly with regard to the existence of an atlantal portion. Despite these inconsistencies, these descriptions have been used to develop physical tests for the integrity of these ligaments in patients with cervical spine problems. The purpose of this study was to describe the detailed macrostructure of the alar ligaments.\nMETHODS: The alar ligaments of 11 cervical spine specimens from embalmed adult cadavers were examined by fine dissection. A detailed description of the macrostructure of these ligaments and their attachment sites was recorded. Measurements were performed with respect to ligament dimensions and relations with selected bony landmarks.\nRESULTS: No atlantal portion of the alar ligament was viewed in any specimen. The attachment of the ligaments on the odontoid process occurred on its lateral and posterolateral aspects, frequently below the level of the apex. The occipital attachment was on the medial surface of the occipital condyles in close proximity to the atlanto-occipital joints. The orientation of the ligaments was primarily horizontal. The presence of transverse bands extending occiput to occiput with minimal or no attachment to the odontoid process was a common variant.\nCONCLUSIONS: The absence of findings with respect to the atlantal portion of the alar ligament suggests that it may be considered an anatomical variant, not an essential component for stability of the craniocervical complex. These findings may inform the use and interpretation of clinical tests for alar ligament integrity.","author":[{"family":"Osmotherly","given":"Peter G."},{"family":"Rivett","given":"Darren A."},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Susan R."}],"citation-key":"osmotherlyRevisitingClinicalAnatomy2013","container-title":"European Spine Journal: Official Publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society","container-title-short":"Eur Spine J","DOI":"10.1007/s00586-012-2496-4","ISSN":"1432-0932","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"60-64","PMCID":"PMC3540300","PMID":"22968541","source":"PubMed","title":"Revisiting the clinical anatomy of the alar ligaments","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

The resulting physiological motions were studied in an unconstrained three-dimensional manner. Effects of sequential transections of the left and right alar ligaments on the relative motions of C0-C1 and C1-C2 were studied. After transection of the left alar ligament, ranges of motion--due to 1.5 Nm torque--increased at both the C0-C1 and C1-C2 joints. Increases were small, on average 1.9 degrees to each side and at each level. Increases due to subsequent cutting of the right alar ligament were, on average, only 0.5 degrees and statistically not significant. In general, neutral zones showed greater increases, e.g., 3.9 degrees to each side at the C1-C2 joint. Comparing right and left axial rotations, after transection of the left alar ligament, showed greater percentage increases for the right, as compared to the left, axial rotation, at both C0-C1 and C1-C2 joints. Functional loss of the alar ligaments indicates a potential for rotatory instability, which, however, must be determined in conjunction with other clinical findings, such as neurological dysfunction, pain, and deformity.","author":[{"family":"Panjabi","given":"M."},{"family":"Dvorak","given":"J."},{"family":"Crisco","given":"J.

  {"id":"parisienImplementationInjuryPrevention2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The estimated cost per year of injuries in collegiate athletics has been reported to be billions of dollars in the United States. Injury prevention programs are often assessed only by their ability to reduce injuries, and there is little evidence of any potential reduction in associated health care costs.\nPURPOSE: To investigate changes in injury-related health care costs at a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I university after the implementation of an injury prevention program.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.\nMETHODS: Included were 12 sports teams that used the injury prevention program (user group) and 16 teams that did not implement the program (nonuser group). The injury surveillance and prevention system (Sparta Science) utilized a commercially available force-plate system to assess kinematic variables, flag high-risk athletes, and guide individual conditioning programs. Data were obtained from 3 academic years before (2012-2014) and 2 academic years after (2015-2016) implementation of the Sparta Science system. The number of injuries and associated health care costs (surgery, clinic visits, imaging, and physical therapy) were compared between users and nonusers.\nRESULTS: Total average annual injuries did not change significantly between users and nonusers after implementation of the program; however, users demonstrated a 23% reduction in clinic visits as compared with a 14% increase for nonusers (P = .049). Users demonstrated a 13% reduction in associated health care encounters, compared with a 13% increase for nonusers (P = .032). Overall health care costs changed significantly for both groups, with an observed 19% decrease ($2,456,154 to $1,978,799) for users and an 8% increase ($1,177,542 to $1,270,846) for nonusers (P < .01 for both). Costs related to associated health care encounters also decreased by 20% for users as compared with a 39% increase for nonusers (P = .027).\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce injury-related health care costs in NCAA Division I athletes via a comprehensive injury surveillance and prevention program utilizing force-plate technology. Given the substantial and appropriate focus on value of care delivery across the US health care system, we recommend the continued study of sports injury surveillance and prevention programs for reducing injury-related health care costs.","author":[{"family":"Parisien","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Pontillo","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"Farooqi","given":"Ali S."},{"family":"Trofa","given":"David P."},{"family":"Sennett","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"parisienImplementationInjuryPrevention2021","container-title":"Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine","container-title-short":"Orthop J Sports Med","DOI":"10.1177/23259671211029898","ISSN":"2325-9671","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"23259671211029898","PMCID":"PMC8450687","PMID":"34552992","source":"PubMed","title":"Implementation of an Injury Prevention Program in NCAA Division I Athletics Reduces Injury-Related Health Care Costs","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

Here, we analyzed systematically the neuropathological findings of the brain in SB cases.\nMETHODS: 79 cases with SB aperta (SBA) and 6 cases with SB occulta (SBO) autopsied at the Charité Neuropathology from 1974 to 2000 were re-evaluated retrospectively. For this, case files and spinal cord as well as brain sections were studied.\nRESULTS: While no brain malformations were detected in SBO cases, 95% of SBA cases had brain malformations. Main brain anomalies identified were hydrocephalus (71%), Chiari II malformation (36%), heterotopia (34%), other cerebellar anomalies (36%), gyrification defects (33%), and ependymal denudation (29%). Hydrocephalus was observed as early as gestational week 17 and was highly associated to Chiari II and ependymal denudation. In 55% SBA was accompanied by further anomalies not primarily affecting the CNS.\nCONCLUSION: We confirm using neuropathologic methods brain malformations in most SBA but none in SBO cases. In addition to our previous radiologic study, we now demonstrate the high prevalence of cerebellar malformations and cerebral heterotopias in SBA. The early detection of hydrocephalus and Chiari II malformation in fetuses raises the question whether these arise parallel rather than in strict temporal sequence.","author":[{"family":"Paschereit","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Schindelmann","given":"Kim Hannah"},{"family":"Hummel","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Stoltenburg-Didinger","given":"Gisela"},{"family":"Kaindl","given":"Angela M."}],"citation-key":"paschereitCerebralAbnormalitiesSpina2022","container-title":"Pediatric and Developmental Pathology: The Official Journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society","container-title-short":"Pediatr Dev Pathol","DOI":"10.1177/10935266211040500","ISSN":"1615-5742","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"eng","page":"107-123","PMCID":"PMC9109215","PMID":"34614376","source":"PubMed","title":"Cerebral Abnormalities in Spina Bifida: A Neuropathological Study","title-short":"Cerebral Abnormalities in Spina Bifida","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

There are no reported estimates of whether this high relative rate of injury continues beyond the first year after RTS and ACLR.\n            \n            \n              Hypothesis:\n              The incidence rate of a subsequent ACL injury in the 2 years after ACLR and RTS would be less than the incidence rate reported within the first 12 months after RTS but greater than the ACL injury incidence rate in an uninjured cohort of young athletes.\n            \n            \n              Study Design:\n              Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Seventy-eight patients (mean age, 17.1 ± 3.1 years) who underwent ACLR and were ready to return to a pivoting/cutting sport and 47 controls (mean age, 17.2 ± 2.6 years) who also participated in pivoting/cutting sports were prospectively enrolled. Each participant was followed for injury and athlete exposure (AE) data for a 24-month period after RTS. Twenty-three ACLR and 4 control participants suffered an ACL injury during this time. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to compare the rates (per 1000 AEs) of ACL injury in athletes in the ACLR and control groups. For the ACLR group, similar comparisons were conducted for side of injury by sex.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              The overall incidence rate of a second ACL injury within 24 months after ACLR and RTS (1.39/1000 AEs) was nearly 6 times greater (IRR, 5.71; 95% CI, 2.0-22.7; P = .0003) than that in healthy control participants (0.24/1000 AEs). The rate of injury within 24 months of RTS for female athletes in the ACLR group was almost 5 times greater (IRR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.5-18.2; P = .0004) than that for female controls. Although only a trend was observed, female patients within the ACLR group were twice as likely (IRR, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.8-8.6) to suffer a contralateral injury (1.13/1000 AEs) than an ipsilateral injury (0.47/1000 AEs). Overall, 29.5% of athletes suffered a second ACL injury within 24 months of RTS, with 20.5% sustaining a contralateral injury and 9.0% incurring a retear injury of the ipsilateral graft. There was a trend toward a higher proportion of female participants (23.7%) who suffered a contralateral injury compared with male participants (10.5%) ( P = .18).

  {"id":"pimentelGuillainBarreSyndromeAssociated2023","abstract":"With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the whole world was impacted by a pandemic. With the passage of time and knowledge about the dynamics and viral propagation of this disease, the short-, medium- and long-term repercussions are still being discovered. During this period, it has been learned that various manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect the nervous system. In recent months, a variety of studies and case reports have proposed an association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The present work aims to systematically review the publications available to date to verify the relationship between these two pathologies and the characteristics of post-COVID GBS. There were 156 studies included in this work, resulting in a total of 436 patients. The findings show a mean age of the patients of 61,38 years and a male majority. The GBS symptoms began on average 19 days after the onset of COVID-19 infection. Regarding GBS, the main manifestations found included generalized weakness, reflex reduction, facial paresis/paralysis and hypoesthesia. As expected, the most common result in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was albuminocytological dissociation. A pattern of blood analysis findings common to all patients was not observed due to non-standardization of case reports. Regarding electrodiagnostic studies, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) appeared as the most common subtype of GBS in this study. There have been reports, to a lesser extent, of acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant (PCB), and Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS). The GBS treatment used was mainly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PLEX). Therefore, the present study reports a high prevalence of hospitalization and intensive care units ICU admissions, conjecturing a relationship between the development of GBS and the severity of COVID-19. Despite the severity, most patients showed improvement in GBS symptoms after treatment, and their residual symptoms did not include motor involvement. Therefore, the development of GBS seems to be related to COVID-19 infection, as reported by the present systematic review.","author":[{"family":"Pimentel","given":"Vitória"},{"family":"Luchsinger","given":"Vanessa Wallau"},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Gabriel Leal"},{"family":"Alcará","given":"Allan Marinho"},{"family":"Esper","given":"Nathalia Bianchini"},{"family":"Marinowic","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Zanirati","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Jaderson Costa","non-dropping-particle":"da"}],"citation-key":"pimentelGuillainBarreSyndromeAssociated2023","container-title":"Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health","container-title-short":"Brain Behav Immun Health","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100578","ISSN":"2666-3546","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"100578","PMCID":"PMC9842533","PMID":"36686624","source":"PubMed","title":"Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with COVID-19: A systematic review","title-short":"Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Deficits in different neurocognitive domains and changes in neurophysiological functions could be a predisposing risk factor for, or a consequence caused by, ACL injuries.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              Clinicians should view ACL injuries not only as a musculoskeletal but also as a neural lesion with neurocognitive and neurophysiological aspects.

  {"id":"rafaelEtiologyTreatmentAmyotrophic2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND: To date all researchers conclude that the etiology of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not known. On the contrary, since August 2009, we believe that disease is of ischemic origin in the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata.\nMATERIAL AND METHOD: We present our surgical experience into 45 patients with ALS (bulbar form in 36 cases and spinal form in 9). Preoperative MRI scans revealed microinfarcts in the medulla oblongata and/or cervical cord. During surgery we found: 1) poor quality of omentum in most cases; 2) degenerative changes in the cervical spine; 3) anatomical anomalies at the V4 segments of the vertebral arteries; 4) moderate to severe atherosclerosis at both V4 segments; 5) unilateral absence or stenosis in the anterior-ventral spinal arteries (AVSAs). All patients received omentum on the anterior, lateral and posterior surface of the medulla oblongata, and in 9 cases, an additional segment at the C5-C6 level.\nRESULTS: Neurological improvement was better during the first days or weeks after surgery than in the following months or years, in all patients. However, 13 patients suffered neurological impairment in about 4 months later, due to greater deterioration of the cervical spine, by contrast, 7 patients with mild ALS have experienced neurological improvement by 80 to 100% during a follow-up of 4 and 6 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that ALS is of ischemic origin in the intraparenchymal territory of the AVSAs and/or in anterior spinal artery caused by atherosclerosis and associated to anatomical variants in the V4 segments of the vertebral arteries. Because in contrast to this, its revascularization by means of omentum can cure (mild degree) or improve this disease.","author":[{"family":"Rafael","given":"Hernando"},{"family":"David","given":"Juan Oscar"},{"family":"Vilca","given":"Antonio Santiago"}],"citation-key":"rafaelEtiologyTreatmentAmyotrophic2017","container-title":"American Journal of Neurodegenerative Disease","container-title-short":"Am J Neurodegener Dis","ISSN":"2165-591X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-8","PMCID":"PMC5435608","PMID":"28533943","source":"PubMed","title":"Etiology and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"rahnamaInjuryRiskAssociated2002","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the exposure of players to injury risk during English Premier League soccer matches in relation to selected factors.\nMETHODS: Injury risk was assessed by rating the injury potential of playing actions during competition with respect to (a) type of playing action, (b) period of the game, (c) zone of the pitch, and (d) playing either at home or away. In all, 10 games from the English Premier League 1999-2000 were chosen for analysis. A notation system was used whereby 16 soccer specific playing actions were classified into three categories: those inducing actual injury, those with a potential for injury (graded as mild, moderate, or high), and those deemed to have no potential for injury. The pitch was divided into 18 zones, and the position of each event was recorded along with time elapsed in the game, enabling six 15 minute periods to be defined.\nRESULTS: Close to 18 000 actions were notated. On average (mean (SD)), 1788 (73) events (one every three seconds), 767 (99) events with injury potential (one every six seconds), and 2 (1) injuries (one every 45 minutes) per game were recorded. An overall injury incidence of 53 per 1000 playing hours was calculated. Receiving a tackle, receiving a \"charge\", and making a tackle were categorised as having a substantial injury risk, and goal catch, goal punch, kicking the ball, shot on goal, set kick, and heading the ball were all categorised as having a significant injury risk. All other actions were deemed low in risk. The first 15 minutes of each half contained the highest number of actions with mild injury potential, the last 15 minutes having the highest number of actions with moderate injury potential (p<0.01). The first and last 15 minutes of the game had the highest number of actions with high injury potential, although not significant. More actions with mild injury potential occurred in the goal area, and more actions with moderate and high injury potential occurred in the zone adjacent to the goal area (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between home and away with regard to injury potential.\nCONCLUSIONS: Playing actions with high injury risk were linked to contesting possession. Injury risk was highest in the first and last 15 minutes of the game, reflecting the intense engagements in the opening period and the possible effect of fatigue in the closing period. Injury risk was concentrated in the areas of the pitch where possession of the ball is most vigorously contested, which were specific attacking and defending zones close to the goal. Injury potential was no greater in away matches than at home.","author":[{"family":"Rahnama","given":"N."},{"family":"Reilly","given":"T."},{"family":"Lees","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"rahnamaInjuryRiskAssociated2002","container-title":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","container-title-short":"Br J Sports Med","DOI":"10.1136/bjsm.36.5.354","ISSN":"0306-3674","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"354-359","PMCID":"PMC1724551","PMID":"12351333","source":"PubMed","title":"Injury risk associated with playing actions during competitive soccer","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},

Knowledge of anatomical variations of posterior cord and its branches is important not only for the administration of anaesthetic blocks but also for surgical approaches to the neck, axilla, and upper arm. The present study aimed to record the prevalence of such variations with embryological explanation and clinical implication. Material and Method. 37 formalin-preserved cadavers, that is, 74 upper extremities from the Indian population, constituted the material for the study. Cadavers were dissected during routine anatomy classes for medical undergraduate. Dissection includes surgical incision in the axilla, followed by retraction of various muscles, to observe and record the formation and branching pattern of posterior cord of brachial plexus. Results. Posterior cord was formed by union of posterior division of C5 and C6 roots with posterior division of middle and lower trunk (there was no upper trunk) in 16.2% of upper extremities. Posterior cord of brachial plexus was present lateral to the second part of axillary artery in 18.9% of upper extremities. Axillary nerve was taking origin from posterior division of upper trunk in 10.8% upper extremities and thoracodorsal nerve arising from axillary nerve in 22.9% upper extremities. Conclusion. It is important to be aware of such variations while planning a surgery in the region of axilla as these nerves are more liable to be injured during surgical procedures.","author":[{"family":"Rastogi","given":"Rakhi"},{"family":"Budhiraja","given":"Virendra"},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Kshitij"}],"citation-key":"rastogiPosteriorCordBrachial2013","container-title":"ISRN anatomy","container-title-short":"ISRN Anat","DOI":"10.5402/2013/501813","ISSN":"2314-4726","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"eng","page":"501813","PMCID":"PMC4392958","PMID":"25969826","source":"PubMed","title":"Posterior cord of brachial plexus and its branches: anatomical variations and clinical implication","title-short":"Posterior cord of brachial plexus and its branches","type":"article-journal","volume":"2013"},

  {"id":"robertsPostexerciseColdWater2015","abstract":"We investigated functional, morphological and molecular adaptations to strength training exercise and cold water immersion (CWI) through two separate studies. In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the CWI group (P < 0.05). Isokinetic work (19%), type II muscle fibre cross-sectional area (17%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26%) increased in the ACT group (all P < 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers were greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was greater after ACT (P < 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery strategy should be reconsidered.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Llion A."},{"family":"Raastad","given":"Truls"},{"family":"Markworth","given":"James F."},{"family":"Figueiredo","given":"Vandre C."},{"family":"Egner","given":"Ingrid M."},{"family":"Shield","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Cameron-Smith","given":"David"},{"family":"Coombes","given":"Jeff S."},{"family":"Peake","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"robertsPostexerciseColdWater2015","container-title":"The Journal of Physiology","container-title-short":"J Physiol","DOI":"10.1113/JP270570","ISSN":"1469-7793","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"4285-4301","PMCID":"PMC4594298","PMID":"26174323","source":"PubMed","title":"Post-exercise cold water immersion attenuates acute anabolic signalling and long-term adaptations in muscle to strength training","type":"article-journal","volume":"593"},

PS is characterized by vague volar forearm pain, with median nerve paresthesias and minimal motor findings. AIN syndrome is a pure motor palsy of any or all of the muscles innervated by that nerve: the flexor pollicis longus, the flexor digitorum profundus of the index and middle fingers, and the pronator quadratus. The sites of anatomic compression are essentially the same for both disorders. Typically, the findings of electrodiagnostic studies are normal in patients with PS and abnormal in those with AIN syndrome. PS is a controversial diagnosis and is typically treated nonsurgically. AIN syndrome is increasingly thought to be neuritis and it often resolves spontaneously following prolonged observation.

  {"id":"romero-martinezCognitiveFlexibilityReaction2022","abstract":"Purpose Current interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators are designed to reduce IPV recidivism by treating risk factors and increasing protective factors. However, these interventions pay less attention to cognitive functioning in IPV perpetrators and how these variables interfere with the future risk of recidivism. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to compare the effectiveness of Standard Intervention Programs for men who perpetrate IPV [SIP] + cognitive training vs SIP + placebo training in promoting cognitive improvements and reducing recidivism. Furthermore, we also aimed to assess whether changes in the risk of recidivism would be related to cognitive changes after the intervention. Method IPV perpetrators who agreed to participate were randomly allocated to receive SIP + cognitive training or SIP + placebo training. Several cognitive variables were assessed before and after the interventions with a complete battery of neuropsychological tests assessing processing speed, memory, attention, executive functions, and emotion decoding abilities. Moreover, we also assessed the risk of recidivism. Results Our data pointed out that only the IPV perpetrators who received the SIP + cognitive training improved their processing speed and cognitive flexibility after this intervention. Furthermore, these participants presented the lowest risk of recidivism after the intervention. Nonetheless, cognitive improvements and reductions in the risk of recidivism after the intervention were unrelated. Conclusions Our study reinforces the importance of implementing cognitive training to reduce risk of recidivism after SIP.

  {"id":"romero-martinezHighTestosteroneLevels2013","abstract":"Hormonal and neuropsychological impairment in intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators could play a role in domestic violence. For characterizing whether there is a specific psychobiological response to stress, participants who had previously been jailed for IPV and controls were compared for testosterone and cortisol levels, tested for 2D:4D ratio (as an indicator of masculinization), and given several trait questionnaires and neuropsychological tests related to executive functions and theory of mind. After performing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), IPV perpetrators experienced decreases in salivary testosterone (T) levels, a moderate worsening of mood, slight anxiety, and a salivary cortisol (C) level increase. Moreover, high basal T was related with high levels of anger and anxiety and worse mood. However, that basal mood does not significantly alter T levels in response to stress. Nonetheless, controls experienced smaller changes in T and larger changes in C and psychological mood. With respect to neuropsychological and cognitive empathic features, IPV perpetrators showed poorer executive performance and emotional recognition than controls. In addition, deficits in both neuropsychological domains were positively associated. Regarding emotional empathy, IPV perpetrators showed higher levels of personal distress than controls. The 2D:4D ratio was lower in IPV perpetrators than in controls. Moreover, only in the former a smaller 2D:4D ratio was related to large increases in T in response to stress and poor emotional recognition. Together with social aspects involved in IPV, differences in psychobiological variables and their relationships could play a relevant role in the onset and perpetuation of violent behavior.","author":[{"family":"Romero-Martínez","given":"Angel"},{"family":"Lila","given":"Marisol"},{"family":"Sariñana-González","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"González-Bono","given":"Esperanza"},{"family":"Moya-Albiol","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"romero-martinezHighTestosteroneLevels2013","container-title":"Aggressive Behavior","container-title-short":"Aggress Behav","DOI":"10.1002/ab.21490","ISSN":"1098-2337","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"eng","page":"355-369","PMID":"23677518","source":"PubMed","title":"High testosterone levels and sensitivity to acute stress in perpetrators of domestic violence with low cognitive flexibility and impairments in their emotional decoding process: a preliminary study","title-short":"High testosterone levels and sensitivity to acute stress in perpetrators of domestic violence with low cognitive flexibility and impairments in their emotional decoding process","type":"article-journal","volume":"39"},

Both the deficits and the expression of violence appear to be more pronounced in men than in women. However, despite the fact that the combination of cocaine and alcohol use may increase the risk of violent reactions, the deficits would not be greater than those resulting from the separate use of each substance. The impairments might be caused by functional abnormalities of certain regions of the frontal (especially the prefrontal) and parietal lobes and some subcortical structures, such as the amygdala.

  {"id":"sasakiCoreMuscleTrainingNeuromuscular2019","abstract":"CONTEXT: Comprehensive injury-prevention training (plyometric, agility, balance, and core-stability exercises) has been shown to decrease sport-related injury. The relationship between trunk control and sport-related injury has been emphasized; however, the isolated effects of core-muscle training are unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a simple 8-week core-muscle-training program on the neuromuscular control of the lower limb and trunk during jump landing and single-legged squatting.\nDESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.\nSETTING: Laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen female collegiate basketball players were randomly divided into training (n = 9; age = 19.7 ± 0.9 years) and control (n = 8; age = 20.3 ± 2.5 years) groups.\nINTERVENTION(S): The training group completed the core-muscle-training program in addition to daily practice, and the control group performed only daily practice. Kinematic and kinetic data during a drop-jump test and single-legged squat were acquired using a 3-dimensional motion-analysis system.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Three-dimensional hip, knee, and trunk kinematics; knee kinetics; and isokinetic muscle strength were measured at the pretraining and posttraining phases.\nRESULTS: For the drop-jump test, the maximal trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .008), and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group. For the single-legged squat, the peak trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .04), and the total amount of trunk lateral-inclination angle (P = .02) and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group.

  {"id":"severComprehensiveResearchFuture2022","abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly debilitating fatal neurodegenerative disorder, causing muscle atrophy and weakness, which leads to paralysis and eventual death. ALS has a multifaceted nature affected by many pathological mechanisms, including oxidative stress (also via protein aggregation), mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, skeletal muscle deterioration and viruses. This complexity is a major obstacle in defeating ALS. At present, riluzole and edaravone are the only drugs that have passed clinical trials for the treatment of ALS, notwithstanding that they showed modest benefits in a limited population of ALS. A dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate combination was also approved to treat pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in the course of ALS. Globally, there is a struggle to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disease, including implementation of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR-9/Cas technique, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) or ALS-on-a-chip technology. Additionally, researchers have synthesized and screened new compounds to be effective in ALS beyond the drug repurposing strategy. Despite all these efforts, ALS treatment is largely limited to palliative care, and there is a strong need for new therapeutics to be developed. This review focuses on and discusses which therapeutic strategies have been followed so far and what can be done in the future for the treatment of ALS.","author":[{"family":"Sever","given":"Belgin"},{"family":"Ciftci","given":"Halilibrahim"},{"family":"DeMirci","given":"Hasan"},{"family":"Sever","given":"Hilal"},{"family":"Ocak","given":"Firdevs"},{"family":"Yulug","given":"Burak"},{"family":"Tateishi","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Tateishi","given":"Takahisa"},{"family":"Otsuka","given":"Masami"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Mikako"},{"family":"Başak","given":"Ayşe Nazlı"}],"citation-key":"severComprehensiveResearchFuture2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"Int J Mol Sci","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23052400","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"language":"eng","page":"2400","PMCID":"PMC8910198","PMID":"35269543","source":"PubMed","title":"Comprehensive Research on Past and Future Therapeutic Strategies Devoted to Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"shahMyofascialTriggerPoints2015","abstract":"The intent of this article is to discuss the evolving role of the myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) from both a historical and scientific perspective. MTrPs are hard, discrete, palpable nodules in a taut band of skeletal muscle that may be spontaneously painful (i.e., active) or painful only on compression (i.e., latent). MPS is a term used to describe a pain condition that can be acute or, more commonly, chronic and involves the muscle and its surrounding connective tissue (e.g. fascia). According to Travell and Simons, MTrPs are central to the syndrome-but are they necessary? Although the clinical study of muscle pain and MTrPs has proliferated over the past two centuries, the scientific literature often seems disjointed and confusing. Unfortunately, much of the terminology, theories, concepts, and diagnostic criteria are inconsistent, incomplete, or controversial. To address these deficiencies, investigators have recently applied clinical, imaging (of skeletal muscle and brain), and biochemical analyses to systematically and objectively study the MTrP and its role in MPS. Data suggest that the soft tissue milieu around the MTrP, neurogenic inflammation, sensitization, and limbic system dysfunction may all play a role in the initiation, amplification, and perpetuation of MPS. The authors chronicle the advances that have led to the current understanding of MTrP pathophysiology and its relationship to MPS, and review the contributions of clinicians and researchers who have influenced and expanded our contemporary level of clinical knowledge and practice.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Jay P."},{"family":"Thaker","given":"Nikki"},{"family":"Heimur","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Aredo","given":"Jacqueline V."},{"family":"Sikdar","given":"Siddhartha"},{"family":"Gerber","given":"Lynn"}],"citation-key":"shahMyofascialTriggerPoints2015","container-title":"PM & R: the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation","container-title-short":"PM R","DOI":"10.1016/j.pmrj.2015.01.024","ISSN":"1934-1563","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"746-761","PMCID":"PMC4508225","PMID":"25724849","source":"PubMed","title":"Myofascial Trigger Points Then and Now: A Historical and Scientific Perspective","title-short":"Myofascial Trigger Points Then and Now","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Moreover, there is evidence of the possible protection of physical activity against disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the question arises if acute or regular exercise has any impact on the immune system in PwMS. To answer this question, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on both plasma and serum cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-α) before and after acute and regular exercise among PwMS and compared to healthy controls.\n            \n            \n              Method\n              We performed an online search via PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library till September 2021 to identify original studies on IL-6 and TNF-α changes after acute and regular exercise in PwMS and controls. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), 11 original studies were included in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were used to identify the origins of heterogeneity. R 4.0.4 was used to perform the meta-analysis of IL-6 and TNF-α levels before and after acute and regular exercise in PwMS, compared to controls. This study does not qualify for a clinical trial number.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                IL-6 levels did neither increase nor decrease after acute and regular exercise in PwMS, and compared to controls (pre- vs. post-intervention: Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI [−0.29; 0.11],\n                p-value\n                 = 0.37, PwMS vs. Control: SMD −0.08, 95% CI [−0.33; 0.16],\n                p-value\n                 = 0.47). In PwMS, TNF-α levels decreased after regular exercise and when TNF-α levels of both acute and regular exercise were pooled (pre- vs. post-intervention: SMD −0.51, 95% CI [-0.91; 0.11],\n                p-value\n                 = 0.01, PwMS vs. Control: SMD −0.23, 95% CI [−0.66; 0.18],\n                p-value\n                 = 0.26).

However, regular exercise had a specific anti-inflammatory effect on blood TNF-α levels in PwMS. It remains to be investigated why PwMS display this different exercise-induced pattern of cytokines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Shobeiri","given":"Parnian"},{"family":"Seyedmirzaei","given":"Homa"},{"family":"Karimi","given":"Nastaran"},{"family":"Rashidi","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Antônio L."},{"family":"Brand","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Sadeghi-Bahmani","given":"Dena"},{"family":"Rezaei","given":"Nima"}],"citation-key":"shobeiriIL6TNFaResponses2022","container-title":"European Journal of Medical Research","container-title-short":"Eur J Med Res","DOI":"10.1186/s40001-022-00814-9","ISSN":"2047-783X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"IL-6 and TNF-α responses to acute and regular exercise in adult individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS): a systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"IL-6 and TNF-α responses to acute and regular exercise in adult individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-022-00814-9","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"tetreaultArePostoperativeHip2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether posterior hip precautions after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) reduce the incidence of early postoperative dislocation.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effect of hip precautions on incidence of early dislocation after primary THA using a posterior approach. Between January 2016 and April 2019, 587 patients (594 hips) were consented and randomized into restricted or unrestricted groups. No significant demographic or surgical differences existed between groups. The restricted group was instructed to refrain from hip flexion >90°, adduction across midline, and internal rotation for 6 weeks. 98.5% (585 of 594) of hips were available for minimum 6-week follow-up (291 restricted and 294 unrestricted). Power analysis showed that 579 hips per group are needed to demonstrate an increase in dislocation rate from 0.5% to 2.5% with 80% power.\nRESULTS: At average follow-up of 15 weeks (range, 6-88), there were 5 dislocations (incidence, 0.85%). Three posterior dislocations occurred in the restricted group at a mean of 32 days (range, 17-47), and 2 posterior dislocations occurred in the unrestricted group at a mean of 112 days (range, 21-203), with no difference in dislocation rate between groups (1.03% vs 0.68%; odds ratio, 0.658; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-3.96; P = .647). At 6 weeks, unrestricted patients endorsed less difficulty with activities of daily living, earlier return to driving, and more time spent side sleeping (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: Preliminary analysis suggests that removal of hip precautions after primary THA using a posterior approach was not associated with early dislocation and facilitated return to daily functions. Investigation to appropriate power is warranted.","author":[{"family":"Tetreault","given":"Matthew W."},{"family":"Akram","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jefferson"},{"family":"Nam","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Gerlinger","given":"Tad L."},{"family":"Della Valle","given":"Craig J."},{"family":"Levine","given":"Brett R."}],"citation-key":"tetreaultArePostoperativeHip2020","container-title":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","container-title-short":"J Arthroplasty","DOI":"10.1016/j.arth.2020.02.019","ISSN":"1532-8406","issue":"6S","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"S246-S251","PMID":"32146109","source":"PubMed","title":"Are Postoperative Hip Precautions Necessary After Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty Using a Posterior Approach?

  {"id":"toughVariabilityCriteriaUsed2007","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the literature review was to investigate the criteria adopted by \"experts\" to diagnose myofascial trigger point (MTrP) pain syndrome. Experts were defined as being either researchers investigating MTrP pain syndrome or the \"authority\" the researchers cited as a source of reference for MTrP pain syndrome diagnosis.\nMETHODS: We searched electronic databases to identify relevant empirical research (excluding studies not in English and those relating to dental pathology). Of 607 possibly relevant publications 93 met our inclusion criteria. We recorded (1) the individual criterion and criteria combinations used to diagnose MTrP pain syndrome; (2) the cited \"authoritative\" publications and (3) the criteria recommended by the authoritative publications as being essential for MTrP pain syndrome diagnosis.\nRESULTS: The review identified 19 different diagnostic criteria. The 4 most commonly applied criteria were: \"tender spot in a taut band\" of skeletal muscle, \"patient pain recognition,\" \"predicted pain referral pattern,\" and \"local twitch response.\" There was no consistent pattern to the choice of specific diagnostic criteria or their combinations. However, one pair of criteria \"tender point in a taut band\" and \"predicted or recognized pain referral\" were used by over half the studies. The great majority of studies cited publications by Travell and more recently Simons as a principal authoritative source for MTrP pain syndrome diagnosis, yet most of these studies failed to apply the diagnostic criteria as described by these authorities.\nDISCUSSION: We conclude that there is as yet limited consensus on case definition in respect of MTrP pain syndrome. Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of diagnostic criteria. Until reliable diagnostic criteria have been established, there is a need for greater transparency in research papers on how a case of MTrP pain syndrome is defined, and claims for effective interventions in treating the condition should be viewed with caution.","author":[{"family":"Tough","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"White","given":"Adrian R."},{"family":"Richards","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"toughVariabilityCriteriaUsed2007","container-title":"The Clinical Journal of Pain","container-title-short":"Clin J Pain","DOI":"10.1097/AJP.0b013e31802fda7c","ISSN":"0749-8047","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","page":"278-286","PMID":"17314589","source":"PubMed","title":"Variability of criteria used to diagnose myofascial trigger point pain syndrome--evidence from a review of the literature","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

The intervention group was instructed to perform 25 sessions of NHE in a 13-week period. Both the intervention and control groups performed regular soccer training and were followed for hamstring injury incidence and severity during the 2013 calendar year.

  {"id":"vescoviEffectsAnteriorCruciate2010","abstract":"Female soccer players are three times more likely to suffer a non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear compared with male soccer players. Several ACL injury prevention programs have been developed and are used to reduce injury risk. However, to date there is limited information on how such programs affect physical performance. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to investigate the effects of the Prevent Injury Enhance Performance (PEP) program in adolescent female soccer players. Four soccer teams were randomly assigned to an intervention (PEP) or control (CON) group and assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks on linear sprinting, countermovement jump (CMJ), and two agility tests. A mixed model factorial ANOVA with repeated measures was used to assess for treatment effects on the dependent variables. Improvements in 27.3 and 36.6 m sprint times (<0.10 s) were evident during the first 6 weeks for PEP, but reverted back to baseline values by 12 weeks; there were no changes for 9.1 or 18.2 m sprint times in either group. There was no change in the CMJ height for PEP; however, there was a decrement at 6 and 12 weeks compared with baseline in CON. Performance on the Illinois and pro-agility tests declined in both groups. Our findings demonstrate that improvements in linear sprint performance were small and transient in adolescent female soccer players, and that there was no benefit of the PEP program on CMJ or agility performance. ACL injury prevention programs designed as a structured warm-up routine seem to lack the necessary stimulus to enhance athletic performance.","author":[{"family":"Vescovi","given":"J.

The underlying pathology remains to be fully elucidated; however, evidence indicates that the disorder does not involve an inflammatory process but rather impairments of the pain and motor systems as well as morphological changes in the structure of both the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle and tendon. Although the most efficient management approach remains controversial, there is a growing body of literature reporting the effects and underlying mechanisms of joint manipulation in the management of lateral epicondylalgia. Evidence exists demonstrating that joint manipulation directed at the elbow and wrist as well as at the cervical and thoracic spinal regions results in clinical alterations in pain and the motor system. In addition to presenting this evidence, this paper describes proposed underlying physiological mechanisms of joint manipulation associated with the observed clinical effects. We propose that this information will be useful for the physical therapist in making clinical decisions regarding the selection of treatment technique for the management of patients with lateral epicondylalgia.","author":[{"family":"Vicenzino","given":"Bill"},{"family":"Cleland","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Bisset","given":"Leanne"}],"citation-key":"vicenzinoJointManipulationManagement2007","container-title":"The Journal of Manual & Manipulative Therapy","container-title-short":"J Man Manip Ther","DOI":"10.1179/106698107791090132","ISSN":"1066-9817","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","page":"50-56","PMCID":"PMC2565595","PMID":"19066643","source":"PubMed","title":"Joint manipulation in the management of lateral epicondylalgia: a clinical commentary","title-short":"Joint manipulation in the management of lateral epicondylalgia","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Microglia contribute to this inflammation by maintaining a primed profile long after the acute effects of the injury have dissipated. This may set the stage for glial dysfunction and hyperactivity to challenges including subsequent head injury, stress, or induction of a peripheral immune response. This review discusses the evidence that microglia become primed following TBI and how this corresponds with vulnerability to a 'second hit' and subsequent neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative complications.","author":[{"family":"Witcher","given":"Kristina G."},{"family":"Eiferman","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Godbout","given":"Jonathan P."}],"citation-key":"witcherPrimingInflammatoryPump2015","container-title":"Trends in Neurosciences","container-title-short":"Trends Neurosci","DOI":"10.1016/j.tins.2015.08.002","ISSN":"1878-108X","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"609-620","PMCID":"PMC4617563","PMID":"26442695","source":"PubMed","title":"Priming the inflammatory pump of the CNS after traumatic brain injury","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"xiaEffectivenessUltrasoundTherapy2017","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to assess the therapeutic effect of ultrasound (US) on myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).\nDATE SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched to find relevant studies from January 1966 to May 2016 using keywords. Four investigators performed the data extraction.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the outcomes of pain and physical function between MPS patients receiving and not receiving US were selected by two researchers independently.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from the RCTs. Risk of bias and study quality were evaluated following the recommendations of Cochrane Collaboration. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 10 studies involving 428 MPS patients were included. US therapy significantly reduced pain intensity (SMD [CI]=-1.41 [-2.15, -0.67], P=0.0002) and increased pain threshold (SMD [CI]=1.08 [0.55, 1.60], P<0.0001), but had no significant effect on cervical range of motion (ROM) of lateral flexion (SMD [CI]=0.40 [-0.19, 0.99], P=0.19), rotation (SMD [CI]=0.10 [-0.33, 0.52], P=0.66), or extension or flexion (SMD [CI]=0.16 [-0.35, 0.68], P=0.53). Heterogeneity between studies was mainly attributed to differences in the follow-up time, parameter of US, course of treatment, and the control group. The overall risk of bias from the included studies was high, and the evidence proving these effect calculations were assessed as low quality.\nCONCLUSION: Owing to the high risk of bias and the across-trial heterogeneity of the studies, the current evidence is not clear enough to support US as an effective method to treat MPS. Clinical trials with methodological rigorousness and adequate power are needed to confirm it in the future.","author":[{"family":"Xia","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoju"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xueping"}],"citation-key":"xiaEffectivenessUltrasoundTherapy2017","container-title":"Journal of Pain Research","container-title-short":"J Pain Res","DOI":"10.2147/JPR.S131482","ISSN":"1178-7090","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"545-555","PMCID":"PMC5349701","PMID":"28331357","source":"PubMed","title":"Effectiveness of ultrasound therapy for myofascial pain syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Effectiveness of ultrasound therapy for myofascial pain syndrome","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"xuSurgeNeurophysiologicalCoupling2023","abstract":"The brain is assumed to be hypoactive during cardiac arrest. However, animal models of cardiac and respiratory arrest demonstrate a surge of gamma oscillations and functional connectivity. To investigate whether these preclinical findings translate to humans, we analyzed electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signals in four comatose dying patients before and after the withdrawal of ventilatory support. Two of the four patients exhibited a rapid and marked surge of gamma power, surge of cross-frequency coupling of gamma waves with slower oscillations, and increased interhemispheric functional and directed connectivity in gamma bands. High-frequency oscillations paralleled the activation of beta/gamma cross-frequency coupling within the somatosensory cortices. Importantly, both patients displayed surges of functional and directed connectivity at multiple frequency bands within the posterior cortical \"hot zone,\" a region postulated to be critical for conscious processing. This gamma activity was stimulated by global hypoxia and surged further as cardiac conditions deteriorated in the dying patients. These data demonstrate that the surge of gamma power and connectivity observed in animal models of cardiac arrest can be observed in select patients during the process of dying.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Mihaylova","given":"Temenuzhka"},{"family":"Li","given":"Duan"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Fangyun"},{"family":"Farrehi","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Parent","given":"Jack M."},{"family":"Mashour","given":"George A."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Borjigin","given":"Jimo"}],"citation-key":"xuSurgeNeurophysiologicalCoupling2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2216268120","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"e2216268120","PMID":"37126719","source":"PubMed","title":"Surge of neurophysiological coupling and connectivity of gamma oscillations in the dying human brain","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"yuElasticFiberNetwork2005","abstract":"STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemical study of elastic fibers in human intervertebral discs (IVD) collected at surgery from patients with scoliosis.\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the elastic fiber network in scoliotic discs (idiopathic scoliosis or neuromuscular scoliosis) to that of control (normal) discs. To study whether the change in elastic fiber organization could contribute to the progression of spinal deformity.\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Elastin and elastic fibers have been identified previously in human IVD but were believed to contribute little to the tissue's mechanical properties. However, a recent immunohistochemical study has revealed an abundant and organized elastic fiber network in bovine IVD, indicating that elastic fibers could play an important mechanical role. This article reports the organization of elastic fibers in human IVD and the changes of elastic fiber organization in scoliosis.\nMETHODS: Intact wedges of IVD were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis (aged 12-22 years). Control discs were obtained from a patient (aged 12 years) with a spinal tumor and a trauma patient (aged 17 years). The discs were dissected to give radial slices and were snap frozen. Frozen sections were cut and digested with hyaluronidase to remove glycosaminoglycans. Micrographs of the sections were examined by polarized light to visualize collagen organization. The elastic fiber network was visualized immunohistochemically or by histochemical staining with orcein.\nRESULTS: A highly organized elastic fiber network, similar to that described in bovine discs, was revealed in the control human discs. In the anulus fibrosus of control discs, dense elastic fibers were located between adjacent lamellae, with fibers also present within individual lamellae. Elastic fibers appeared to be long (>200 microm) and straight in outer anulus, whereas in inner anulus, they nearly ran parallel to each other and at an angle of approximately 60 degrees or 120 degrees to those in adjacent lamellae. However, in scoliotic discs, elastic fibers were sparse, and the collagen and elastic fiber networks were disorganized with loss of lamellar structure. Cell clusters, one of typical degenerative feature, were seen in scoliotic discs but not in age-matched control discs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an abundant and organized network of elastic fibers in the adolescent (12 and 17-year-olds) human IVD, and suggest that elastic fiber network plays a significant biomechanical role. This network is sparse and disrupted in scoliotic discs, and could be involved in the progression of the spinal deformity.","author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Fairbank","given":"Jeremy C.

  {"id":"zagoFatigueInducedRepeated2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The etiology of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury in women football results from the interaction of several extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors. Extrinsic factors change dynamically, also due to fatigue. However, existing biomechanical findings concerning the impact of fatigue on the risk of ACL injuries remains inconsistent. We hypothesized that fatigue induced by acute workload in short and intense game periods, might in either of two ways: by pushing lower limbs mechanics toward a pattern close to injury mechanism, or alternatively by inducing opposed protective compensatory adjustments.\nAIM: In this study, we aimed at assessing the extent to which fatigue impact on joints kinematics and kinetics while performing repeated changes of direction (CoDs) in the light of the ACL risk factors.\nMETHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional associative study. Twenty female players (age: 20-31 years, 1st-2nd Italian division) performed a continuous shuttle run test (5-m) involving repeated 180°-CoDs until exhaustion. During the whole test, 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces were used to compute lower limb joints angles and internal moments. Measures of exercise internal load were: peak post-exercise blood lactate concentration, heart rate (HR) and perceived exertion. Continuous linear correlations between kinematics/kinetics waveforms (during the ground contact phase of the pivoting limb) and the number of consecutive CoD were computed during the exercise using a Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) approach.\nRESULTS: The test lasted 153 ± 72 s, with a rate of 14 ± 2 CoDs/min. Participants reached 95% of maximum HR and a peak lactate concentration of 11.2 ± 2.8 mmol/L. Exercise duration was inversely related to lactate concentration (r = -0.517, p < 0.01), while neither%HR max nor [La-] b nor RPE were correlated with test duration before exhaustion (p > 0.05). Alterations in lower limb kinematics were found in 100%, and in lower limb kinetics in 85% of the players. The most common kinematic pattern was a concurrent progressive reduction in hip and knee flexion angle at initial contact (10 players); 5 of them also showed a significantly more adducted hip. Knee extension moment decreased in 8, knee valgus moment increased in 5 players. A subset of participants showed a drift of pivoting limb kinematics that matches the known ACL injury mechanism; other players displayed less definite or even opposed behaviors.\nDISCUSSION: Players exhibited different strategies to cope with repeated CoDs, ranging from protective to potentially dangerous behaviors. While the latter was not a univocal effect, it reinforces the importance of individual biomechanical assessment when coping with fatigue.","author":[{"family":"Zago","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"David","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Bertozzi","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Brunetti","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Salaorni","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Tarabini","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Galvani","given":"Christel"},{"family":"Sforza","given":"Chiarella"},{"family":"Galli","given":"Manuela"}],"citation-key":"zagoFatigueInducedRepeated2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology","container-title-short":"Front Bioeng Biotechnol","DOI":"10.3389/fbioe.2021.666841","ISSN":"2296-4185","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"eng","page":"666841","PMCID":"PMC8287513","PMID":"34291039","source":"PubMed","title":"Fatigue Induced by Repeated Changes of Direction in Élite Female Football (Soccer) Players: Impact on Lower Limb Biomechanics and Implications for ACL Injury Prevention","title-short":"Fatigue Induced by Repeated Changes of Direction in Élite Female Football (Soccer) Players","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

It has been suggested that the pathology of tendons and other connective tissue structures within the carpal tunnel may be involved in its etiology. The objective of this study was to review the literature about the potential role of genetic factors in the etiology of CTS. Three different mechanisms are suspected to be involved in genetic predisposition to CTS: collagen synthesis, collagen degradation and protection against oxidative stress effect in connective tissue. Several gene groups are involved in the regulation and modulation of these mechanisms, and the research reviewed in this study showed their possible effect on the development of CTS. Variants within the COL1A1, COL5A1 and COL11A1 genes - encoding the synthesis of minor collagen subtypes - may potentially be involved, as they alter the mechanical properties of tendons and other connective tissue structures within the carpal tunnel. The collagen within connective tissue structures is also remodeled by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), so variants of these genes have also been investigated for their possible role in the risk of CTS development. Next, the variants of genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) synthesis were found to be involved in the etiology of CTS. The findings from the abovementioned studies provide reliable information on the potential role of genetic risk factors in the development of CTS.","author":[{"family":"Żyluk","given":"Andrzej"}],"citation-key":"zylukRoleGeneticFactors2020","container-title":"Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine: Official Organ Wroclaw Medical University","container-title-short":"Adv Clin Exp Med","DOI":"10.17219/acem/118846","ISSN":"1899-5276","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"623-628","PMID":"32407610","source":"PubMed","title":"The role of genetic factors in carpal tunnel syndrome etiology: A review","title-short":"The role of genetic factors in carpal tunnel syndrome etiology","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"}
